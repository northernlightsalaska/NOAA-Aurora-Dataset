This solar event also resulted in a full halo CME with an impressive post-CME arcade on SXI and EIT imagery. Most of the ejecta associated with this CME did not appear to be Earth-directed. A third faint halo CME was also observed on LASCO imagery on 04/1254Z. This CME was likely associated with the C7 flare in Region 715 on 04/1113Z.

Transient flow, likely the CME activity from 04 and 05 January, impacted the geomagnetic field first at around 07/0900Z. The existing elevated solar wind speed increased from 500 km/s to just over 600 km/s. The major storming followed a period of sustained southward Bz to near -10 nT between 07/1300 - 1500Z.  A second disturbance passed the ACE spacecraft at 07/2010Z. Only a weak enhancement was observed on the plasma measurements; however, the IMF Bz turned sharply southward to near -15 nT. The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit was at high levels again this period. The energetic electrons, which have been sustained at high levels since 03 January, dropped below the high threshold at approximately 07/1900Z."

There was no CME associated with this X-class flare. An impulsive M8 flare was observed at 15/0431Z, and at 15/0638Z, the region produced the most significant event of the period, a long duration M8 flare. This event had associated intense radio emission including a 160,000 sfu burst on 410 MHz and moderate to strong centimetric bursts including a 3000 sfu Tenflare. Type II (1300 km/s) and Type IV radio sweeps were also observed, and the energetic protons (>10 MeV) began to rise soon after the flare maximum. SOHO/LASCO imagery revealed a fast full halo coronal mass ejection. Region 720 is a large and magnetically complex sunspot group with white light area coverage exceeding 1600 millionths. Strong shear along an extended east-west inversion line in this region was the focal point for the major flare activity.

Solar wind speeds were elevated (700-900 km/s) from the start of the interval up through at least 0700 UTC, after which the ACE real-time SWEPAM data became unusable due to elevated energetic particle flux. The interplanetary magnetic field, however, was weak with fluctuations between -4 nT to +6 nT. A new injection of protons was observed at 0650 UTC in association with the X7 flare. The greater than 100 MeV protons rose rapidly and attained a maximum of 652 PFU at 0710 UTC. The 100 MeV flux has been declining steadily since then. This high flux level makes this the largest greater than 100 MeV proton event observed since October 1989. A greater than 10 MeV proton event was in progress at the time of the new injection, but the new particles quickly increased the flux from initial values around 40 PFU to a peak value in the past 24 hours of 1860 PFU at 0810 UTC."

This is consistent with solar observations which indicate the presence of a favorably positioned coronal hole just a few degrees behind a solar magnetic polarity inversion line. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes reached high levels during the past 24 hours."

The solar wind signatures appear to indicate the onset of a coronal hole high speed stream which has been modified by transient flow from the CME of 06/1728 UTC.

A weak transient signature (likely from the X1 related CME activity seen on 14 July) was detected at the ACE spacecraft near 17/0000Z where the wind speeds increased from near 425 km/sec to 500 km/sec. Minor storming was later observed between 17/0900 and 1200Z.  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began on 14/0245Z, had a peak flux of 134 pfu at 15/0345Z, and underwent an injection of flux at 17/1735Z allowing for the event to remain in-progress at near 17 pfu at the time of this writing.  The source believed responsible for the increase in proton flux was the back-sided activity relating to the full halo CME mentioned in 1A."

The event had a long decay time and was associated with Type II and Type IV radio sweeps. The event was also associated with a fast, full halo CME. The CME had an estimated plane-of-sky speed in the range of 1700-1800 km/s in the LASCO C3 field of view, and was somewhat asymmetric towards the east. Region 792 consists of a compact cluster of spots and appears to have at least two delta configurations within its complex magnetic configuration. In addition to the X-flare, Region 792 also produced a C9/1n at 0519 UTC and a C8/Sf at 1707 UTC. Another CME has been observed following the C8 event, but so far appears to be a limb event rather than a partial or full halo event."

The second shock was observed at 0828 UTC and was followed by about 6 hours of major to severe storm level activity, which was driven by high velocity and very strongly negative interplanetary magnetic field component Bz (which reached about -56 nT). Activity declined to minor storm levels after 1500 UTC and remained there through the end of the period. The solar wind remains elevated but is slowly declining; Bz turned mostly northwards and substantially weakened although the total solar wind magnetic field remains high (about 20 nT). The solar wind signatures are most consistent with the successive arrivals of CMEs associated with the M2 of 22/0133 UTC and the M5 of 22/1727 UTC. The  greater than 10 MeV proton event that began at 22/2040 UTC and reached a maximum of 330 PFU at 23/1045 UTC continues in progress with flux of about 19 PFU at the end of the period."

An X17/3b white light flare erupted in this region at 07/1740Z.  A large and fast CME was visible on the MK4 coronagraph at Mauna Loa. Intense centimetric radio bursts accompanied this flare, including a 27,000 sfu Tenflare. Type II (1860 km/s) and Type IV radio sweeps were also observed. This region also produced a very long duration M1 flare, which peaked at 06/2202Z. A fast and bright CME (1400 km/s) on LASCO imagery was observed with this event. The sunspot cluster associated with Region 808 is just now rotating into view, so an accurate  assessment of its true size and complexity will have to wait. Region 808 is the return of old Region 798, which produced significant solar and geophysical activity during its last passage on the visible disk."
