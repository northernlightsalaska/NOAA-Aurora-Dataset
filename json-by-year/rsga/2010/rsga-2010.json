Conditions were initially quiet to unsettled, but increased to active levels after 0300Z, and increased further to major to severe storm levels between 0900-1200Z. The increase in activity followed a strong shock observed at the ACE spacecraft at 0756Z which led to a sudden impulse at Earth at 0826Z (observed to be 38 nT at the Boulder magnetometer). Numerous high-latitude stations reported severe storm levels during the interval as did several mid-latitude stations in the nighttime sectors. Activity declined to active to major storm levels from 1200-1800Z and declined further to mostly unsettled levels from 1800-2100Z. Solar wind observations showed elevated solar wind velocity behind the shock with speeds between 720-800 km/s with fairly strong Bz (peak negative values around -15 nT). Solar wind speed and magnetic field observations showed a decreasing trend during the last 4-5 hours of the interval. The most probable source for the disturbance is the halo CME that was observed on 03 April at 0954Z. The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels during the past 24 hours."

Activity was quiet through about 1100Z when levels increased to active to minor storming at middle latitudes, with major storm periods observed at high latitudes. At about 0900Z, observations from the ACE spacecraft indicated increases in temperature, density and wind velocity, while the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field showed strong negative incursions to -20 nT. Wind speeds gradually increased from about 375 km/s to near 700 km/s by 1645Z. Thereafter, wind speeds leveled out to about 650 km/s, and remained so through the balance of the period.

This event was first observed on the C2 imagery around 24/1406Z.  The latest analysis indicated its signature as a partial halo CME.  A long duration B1 flare at 24/1446Z was also associated with this event.  Region 1072 (S15W22) has decreased slightly in white light areal coverage and sunspot count and is a beta magnetic configuration."

By 11/0900Z, geomagnetic activity increased at all latitudes to predominately unsettled to active levels with an isolated minor storm period observed between 11/1200 - 1500Z.  At approximately 11/0300Z, measurements at the ACE spacecraft observed flucuations in the B component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) along with a sharp increase in density and a slight increase in wind velocity. The IMF Bz reached a maximum of -13 nT at 11/0915Z, and remained southward through 11/1805Z.  The IMF Bt hit a maximum of 14 nT at 11/0936Z while density reached a peak of 47 p/cc at 11/0509Z.  Wind velocities increased slightly from a low of 325 km/s at the beginning of the summary period and peaked near 375 km/s at 11/1826Z.  The increase in activity is most likely a result of a glancing blow from the 06 October full-halo CME."

Geomagnetic activity increased to active to minor storm levels through 17/0900Z, returning to mostly quiet levels through the remainder of the period. At about 17/0400Z, signatures at the ACE satellite indicated gradual increases in temperature, density and wind velocity. The Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) turned southward, and remained south for about 7 hours, reaching a maximum deflection of -7nT at 17/0737Z. The Bt component of the IMF reached a maximum of 10nT at 17/0520Z. This short-lived disturbance is thought to have been a result of a glancing blow from the slow-moving CME observed on 10 October."

An associated CME, visible in SOHO/LASCO C2 imagery, was seen lifting off the northwest limb at 14/1536Z.  The CME did not appear to be earth-directed."

Observations from the ACE spacecraft indicated a sharp decrease in the Bz component of the IMF (-13nT at 28/1401Z) while the Bt component reached a maximum value of 14nT at 28/1315Z. The field responded with an isolated minor storm period from 28/1200 - 1500Z at all latitudes. Thereafter, storm conditions diminished to unsettled to active levels through the end of the summary period."
