SOMEWHAT MORE IMPRESSIVE WAS A LONG DURATION M4/2B FLARE FROM REGION 7042 (S11W16) WHICH LASTED ABOUT 150 MINUTES. THE M4 FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MODERATELY STRONG RADIO BURSTS AND A MODERATE TYPE IV SWEEP. ADDITIONAL M-FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE DAY: AN M2/1B AT 1356Z FROM 7048 (S04E24) AND AN M4 AT 2103UT. THE SOURCE FOR THE LATTER APPEARS TO BE 7030 SINCE STRONG SURGING WAS SEEN ON WEST LIMB AT 7030'S LATITUDE DURING THE EVENT. REGION 7042 IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE LOOKING REGION ON THE DISK, BUT SHOWED DECAY AND FRAGMENTATION DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS. REGION 7039 SHOWS BOTH GROWTH AND DECAY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE GROUP AND APPEARS TO BE COMBINING WITH REGION 7035 (S18W52). NOTE: CORRECTION TO YESTERDAY'S REPORT - THE M3 AT 2032Z WAS FROM THE SOUTHWEST LIMB (S07W89), NOT THE SOUTHEAST (S07E89) AS WAS STATED."
