THE SECOND CME OCCURRED NEAR 03/1000Z FROM HIGH LATITUDES IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT.

REGION 8190 HAS SHOWN STEADY GROWTH DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS AND WAS THE SOURCE OF THE MAJORITY OF TODAY'S FLARE ACTIVITY. NEW REGION 8191 (S23E48) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY AND IS A SMALL BIPOLAR GROUP JUST EAST OF 8190. REGION 8185 (S25W51) IS STILL THE LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK BUT WAS DECLINING IN SUNSPOT AREA AND MAGNETIC FIELD INTENSITY. LASCO IMAGES BEGINNING AT 31/0626Z SHOWED A LARGE ERUPTION OF MATERIAL; THE PROJECTION WAS FROM THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE DISK. THE LACK OF ANY CORRESPONDING SIGNATURES ON THE DISK SUGGEST THAT THE SOURCE WAS PROBABLY ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SUN."

THE X2 WAS JUST PRECEDED BY AN M2 FROM THE SAME REGION AT 0725Z. REGION 8210 ALSO PRODUCED AN M2/2N FLARE AT 05/2346Z WHICH HAD ASSOCIATED TYPE II AND TYPE IV SWEEPS. LASCO OBSERVERS REPORTED THREE CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS DURING THE TIME PERIOD: THE FIRST WAS A PARTIAL HALO AT 0002Z AND COULD BE REASONABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE M2/2N. THE SECOND WAS AT 0228Z FROM THE NORTH EAST AND APPEARS TO BE AN EVENT BEHIND THE LIMB. THE THIRD, SEEN AT 0829Z WAS A LARGE AND RELATIVELY FAST EVENT THAT APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE X2 FLARE. REGION 8214 (N28W34) HAS NOT BEEN IMPRESSIVE IN TERMS OF FLARE PRODUCTION, BUT IT CONTINUES TO GROW IN COMPLEXITY AND CONTINUES TO DISPLAY VERY HOT PLAGE. SOME OPPOSITE POLARITY FLUX IS EMERGING JUST WEST OF THE LEADER SPOT, AND THIS PART OF THE GROUP APPEARS TO BE THE 'HOT SPOT' IN THE REGION. REGION 8210 (S15W75) IS APPROACHING WEST LIMB, MAKING ANALYSIS MORE DIFFICULT. THERE MAY BE SOME REFORMING OF THE DELTA CONFIGURATION IN THE LEADER SPOT. A 10 DEGREE FILAMENT NEAR N20W46 DISAPPEARED BETWEEN 05/1130Z AND 06/0657Z.NEW REGION 8218 (S23E74) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY AND IS A SIMPLE AXX SPOT GROUP."

REGION 8419 WAS ACTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD BUT BEGAN TO QUIET DOWN AROUND 29/0300Z. WHITE LIGHT OBSERVATIONS SHOW THE LOSS OF PENUMBRAL AREA IN THE TRAILING PORTION OF THE REGION. THE MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION HAS SIMPLIFIED TO A BETA-GAMMA CLASS. IN CONTRAST, REGION 8421 HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS AND BEGAN PRODUCING FREQUENT C-CLASS SUBFLARES DURING THE LAST 12 HOURS OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. WHITE LIGHT AND MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS SHOW A LARGE, COMPACT SUNSPOT GROUP WITH AT LEAST ONE, AND POSSIBLY TWO DELTA CONFIGURATIONS. THE MAIN INVERSION LINE RUNS FROM EAST-NORTHEAST TO WEST-SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE REGION."

A FEW HIGH-LATITUDE STATIONS SAW SUBSTORM EFFECTS BETWEEN 1000-1400Z, BUT THE DISTURBANCE WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE ACTIVE LEVELS AT MID-LATITUDES. THE LATTER PART OF THE DAY (FROM 1500-2100Z) WAS PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED WITH OCCASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS AT THE HIGHER LATITUDE SITES. REAL-TIME SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SLIGHTLY ENHANCED DENSITY, VELOCITY AND MAGNETIC FIELDS, AND SOMEWHAT LOW TEMPERATURES, SUGGESTING THAT THE CURRENT ACTIVITY IS BEING CAUSED BY TRANSIENT MATERIAL IN THE SOLAR WIND."
