THE GROUP IS MAGNETICALLY COMPLICATED WITH STRONG FIELDS AND GRADIENTS IN A DELTA CONFIGURATION, AND HAS SHOWN CONTINUED GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD. AN M5 FLARE OCCURRED AT 1717Z WITHOUT ANY SIGNATURE IN OPTICAL WAVELENGTHS, SUGGESTING THAT AN EVENT OCCURRED BEHIND ONE OF THE SOLAR LIMBS. REGION 5311 (S14E33) GREW SIGNIFICANTLY AND APPEARED TO HAVE EVOLVED TO A MAGNETIC DELTA CONFIGURATION BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE EAST LIMB WAS ACTIVE TODAY: CORONAGRAPH OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SEVERAL CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS OCCURRED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS; PROMINENCE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED AT S30, N20, AND N32, AND SURGE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED AT ABOUT N30. EXITING REGION 5301 (S18W92) ALSO PRODUCED STRONG SURGING DURING THE DAY WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY BRIGHT FROM 0219-0520Z. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES OBSERVED FOR THE PERIOD WERE AN M1 AT 2257Z, AN M2 AT 0654Z, AN M1/SF FROM 5310 (S25E10) AT 1509Z, AN M1/SF FROM 5312 AT 1908Z, AN M1/SF FROM 5311 AT 1910Z, AND AN M1 AT 1955Z.

REGION 5669 WAS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO BE THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 5629 WHICH PRODUCED 5 X-CLASS FLARES ON IT'S LAST TRANSIT. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT REGION 5669 WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES AHEAD OF WHERE OLD 5629 SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M1 OCCURRED AT 29/0202Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 360 SFU TENFLARE AND A SIGNIFICANT TYPE II RADIO SWEEP (VELOCITY ESTIMATED AT 1000 KM/SEC.).
