Region 1654 (N09W88) produced two B3 flares while Region 1660 (N12W15) was fairly quiet, yet was the most magnetically complex region on the disk.  It has continued to show growth in the trailer spots and extended its length from five degrees to just over seven.  This region currently appears to be a Dai/Beta-Gamma region and will be the area of interest for the next few days."
