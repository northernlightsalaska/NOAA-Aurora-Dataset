Due to the location of this region, and the lack of a CME in imagery, no Earth impacts are expected. The second C-class flare was a long duration C2 flare at 05/1238Z from an eruptive filament channel, located around Region 1392 (N21W19). The associated CME can be seen in STEREO ahead and behind imagery and is not expected to impact Earth. Finally, a new Region emerged on the disk early in the period and was numbered as Region 1393 (N18W03)."

Region 1423 (N18E15) is the largest group on the disk but is small and unimpressive. A filament eruption was observed over the north-east limb in the SDO AIA 304 imagery at about 27/1433Z and appears to be associated with a CME seen in LASCO imagery over the north pole. Another CME was noted in LASCO at 27/2012Z over the west limb but STEREO-A EUVI images clearly show that the solar source region behind the west limb. Neither of these CMEs are expected to be geoeffective."

A weak shock passed the ACE spacecraft at 26/2058Z and was followed by a sudden impulse at Earth at 26/2141Z. Unsettled to active levels prevailed for the subsequent nine hours, followed by about nine hours of mostly quiet levels. However, solar wind data showed a sustained interval of moderately negative Bz from about 1000-1800Z and conditions increased to active levels from 1200-2100Z with a minor storm period during the last three hours of the interval. The timing and solar wind signatures suggest that disturbance is most likely due to passage of the CME that was initiated early on 24 February. The greater than 10 MeV protons continued to be elevated but were on the decline during the day with end-of-period values less than 1 PFU. Further analysis and comparison with ACE EPAM and ACE SIS show that these particles were likely also associated with the 24 February CME."

The planetary activity reached active levels but several individual stations attained minor storm levels during the disturbance. Activity promptly returned to predominantly quiet levels after the substorm and remained quiet for the rest of the period. The disturbance was preceded by about two hours of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) seen at the ACE spacecraft (0510-0702Z, with maximum southward deflection of -11 nT). The IMF was otherwise predominantly northwards during the interval. ACE data also indicated a solar sector boundary crossing at about 1534Z.

Geomagnetic activity increased to minor to major storm levels following the SSC with some periods of severe storm levels at high latitudes. The disturbance most likely originated from the X1/halo CME that occurred on 05 March. A greater than 10 MeV proton event began at 07/0500Z and has reached a peak so far of 1630 PFU at 1540Z.

Both flares had associated CMEs.  The first CME appeared in SOHO/LASCO C2 imagery at 10/1624Z with the majority of the ejecta off the NW limb.  The second CME, associated with the M8 flare, first appeared in C2 imagery at 10/1800Z.  Further analysis will be done as imagery becomes available, however initial analysis indicated the event produced a full-halo CME with an estimated plane-of-sky speed between 1200 - 1400 km/s.  Region 1429 remained a large Ekc spot class with a Beta-Gamma-Delta magnetic class.  A new region appeared on the ENE limb near Region 1432 (N16E52).

Early in the period, a full-halo CME was observed in LASCO C2 imagery, but analysis indicated this was a backsided event. Around 02/1007Z, in SDO imagery, a large filament was observed lifting off the northwest limb of the solar disk. LASCO C2 imagery showed a CME around 02/1336Z that is believed to be associated with the filament eruption. Further analysis is needed to determine if this CME will become geoeffective.

The background x-ray levels, as measured by the GOES-15 spacecraft, have shown a gradual increase to C-class levels. This increase is attributed to a new unnumbered sunspot region rotating onto the northeast limb. At the time of the report, SDO intensitygram images showed only a part of this new region. Due to the limb location, actual sunspot and magnetic classification has yet to be determined. The other sunspot regions on the disk remained rather stable for the past 24 hours. A CME, first observed in STEREO Ahead COR2 imagery at 04/0309Z, was determined to not be Earth directed."

The regions proximity to the limb makes spot classification difficult, however, it is currently considered a Dko-beta type group. Region 1469 (S26W77) continues to produce low level C-class activity as it rotates around the west limb. A model run was completed after the forecast was issued yesterday to include the CME observed off the southwest limb yesterday. It was determined that the CME has a slight Earth-directed component. A second CME, first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 05/0309Z, appeared to be associated with a C1 flare from Region 1469 observed at 04/2350Z. Although both CMEs have a weak Earth-directed component, neither are expected to cause significant geomagnetic activity. A third CME associated with a C2/Sf flare from Region 1470 (S15W31) observed at 05/0639Z, first became visible in SDO AIA imagery at approximately 05/0600Z. Due to the source location, it is probable that the CME is Earth-directed and a model run is currently in progress to determine geoeffectiveness."

This sunspot complex produced an M1/1n x-ray event at 07/1431Z. Multiple discrete radio frequency bursts were associated with this event, as well as a 240 sfu Tenflare and a Type IV radio sweep. These characteristics, as well as COR2 imagery from the STEREO A spacecraft suggest an Earth directed CME. Initial analysis suggests only a weak disturbance of the Earths magnetic field. Earlier in the day around 07/0400Z, another CME was observed in STEREO A imagery but after analysis, it was determined to not have an Earth-directed component. Region 1476 continues to grow in size and magnetic complexity as it rotates further onto the solar disk."

Region 1476 (N12E08) was responsible for almost all of the activity with 3 M-class events observed, the largest being a M5/2b event at 10/0418Z. Associated with these events, were discrete frequency radio bursts, Tenflares, and even a Type IV radio sweep. Region 1476 has shown mixed growth and shear effects across the polarities as it continues to evolve. A weak Earth directed CME was observed in STEREO COR2 A and B imagery early in the period. Analysis and current models show this CME joining the current coronal hole high speed stream (CH HSS). Region 1477 (S22E47) was split into two regions today as SDO magnetogram data indicated the leader and follower sunspot groups were actually two magnetic bipoles. Leader group is Region 1477 and follower group is now Region 1478 (S24E55)."

Three sudden impulses were observed today at 0957Z, 2019Z, and 2115Z (28 nT, 28 nT, and 25 nT, respectively, as measured by the Boulder USGS magnetometer). ACE data indicated three shock arrivals at around 0900Z, 1931Z, and 2031Z. Solar wind speed ACE increased to around 425 km/s and total field strength reached 10 nT with the first shock passage,  450 km/s and 17 nT with the second, and 530 km/s and 34 nT with the third. The greater than 10 MeV proton event began at 1955Z, reached a maximum flux of 14.4 PFU at 2020Z, and remains in progress at the time of forecast."

The region remained a complex beta-gamma-delta magnetic configuration.  During the past 24 hours, Region 1521 elongated along its E/W axis and developed a gamma configuration in its trailer spots.  The region is now classified as an E-type beta-gamma group.  A 20 degree long filament erupted in the NE quadrant of the disk at about 11/0930Z.  The eruption occurred along a channel centered near N22E22.  Limited LASCO imagery hinted at a possible CME that lifted off the NNE limb likely associated with the filament eruption.  Further analysis of this CME is ongoing."

The source region appeared to primarily be Region 1520 (S17W75), although it appears that Region 1521 (S19W85) was involved in the early phase and may have been the initial trigger for the overall event. An associated, bright CME was observed off the southwest limb beginning at 1400Z; the leading edge plane-of-sky speed was estimated to be about 960 km/s in the LASCO C3 field of view. The proximity of Regions 1519 (S17 just past west limb), 1520, and 1521 to the west limb hindered analysis of the spot groups. New Region 1524 (S18E52) was assigned and is a simple C-type sunspot group. An additional new spot group appeared to be emerging just south of Region 1524."

Correlations with STEREO-A COR2 imagery indicated ejecta movement was slightly south of the ecliptic plane with a possible Earth-directed component.  This CME was likely the result of a small filament eruption just south of central disk observed in H-alpha imagery at approximately 24/2235Z.

There were two CMEs observed during the period. The first, associated with the M6/2n flare on 28 July, was visible in SOHO LASCO and the STEREO coronagraphs with a relatively slow speed (382 km/s estimated) and sourced from the southeast quadrant of the disk. ENLIL model runs suggest a possible weak glancing blow to earth, but beyond the forecast period. The second CME was associated with a erupted filament from the southeast quadrant just after 29/0000Z. Due to a lack of SOHO LASCO imagery, this event is only visible in STEREO A/B COR2, but appears to have a trajectory farther south and east than the first transient, and is not expected to be geoeffective."

At about 19/2300Z, wind speed and temperature indicated slight increases while IMF Bz began fluctuating between +8 to -6 nT.  By about 20/0100Z, the phi angle changed from a positive (away) to a negative (toward) orientation.

Solar wind velocities increased very little with this initial phase of the CME, increasing from around 280 - 320 km/s. The total IMF increased as the CME arrived, with sustained periods of negative Bz. However, with the lower than expected solar wind speeds, very little geomagnetic effects have been observed."

The period began with quiet to unsettled conditions through 13/0300Z.  A sustained period of southward Bz to -11 nT for approximately 13 hours resulted in active to minor storm conditions with major to severe storm periods at high latitudes.  At about 13/0650Z, the phi angle changed from a negative (toward) orientation to a positive (away) orientation, indicating a solar sector boundary crossing. This was followed by increases in density, temperature, and solar wind speed indicative of a co-rotating interaction region in advance of a coronal hole high speed stream (CH HSS).  By 13/1618Z, solar wind speed increased from approximately 530 km/s to 590 km/s while the total magnetic field (Bt) decreased to 5 nT as the CH HSS became geoeffective. The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels during the period."

Analysis of the CME via LASCO and STEREO indicate that the transient should not affect Earth. However, further analysis of the CME noted in the forecast yesterday has determined that there were two separate events, both from filament eruptions, and both with Earthward trajectories. A new, but unnumbered region, is beginning to rotate around the Southeast limb of the disk.  All regions currently on the disk were unchanged or in decay."

Further magnetic simplification was observed in Region 1618s leader spot, however it contained a delta in its larger trailing spot earlier in the period. Region 1620 (S13W14) appeared to develop gamma characteristics over the past 24 hours.  New flux emergence was noted in the southeast quadrant near S17E38 and S24E30.

Region 1620 (S12W43) continued to show growth in its intermediate spots and developed magnetically into a beta-gamma-delta configuration. Two CMEs were observed this morning. The first became visible as an EUV wave in SDO/AIA 193 imagery beginning around 27/0245Z near N28E46 and appears to have been associated with a disappearing filament.
