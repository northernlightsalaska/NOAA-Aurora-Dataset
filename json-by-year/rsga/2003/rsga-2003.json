It was the likely source of several small C-class flares and was responsible for today's largest event, a C6 flare at 14/0636Z. The largest region on the disk is Region 255 (S13W12). This region's close proximity to Region 251 (S14W05) adds complexity, but activity this period was limited to occasional fluctuations in the plage field. A large prominence eruption off the SE limb was observed to begin at around 14/1700Z. New Regions 258 (N07E56) and 259 (N13E72) were numbered today. Limb proximity hinders a thorough analysis, but limb activity was considerable over the past few days in the vicinity of these newly numbered regions."

Newly assigned Region 269 (S09E76) produced the largest flare during the period, an M1.9 x-ray event with associated loops occurred at 21/1526 UTC (no optical flare reported due to source center being just beyond the east limb).  Based on NASA/LASCO imagery, this event produced a CME and it is doubtful that it will become geoeffective. Unable to determine how mature this region is at the time of this writing due to it's proximity to the east limb.  Region 260 (N14W00) produced several C-class events throughout the interval and became slightly more magnetically complex during the past 24 hours.  A C8.1 flare (correlated using SOHO/EIT imagery) occurred at 21/0228 UTC with an associated Type II radio sweep that had an estimated shock velocity of 700 km/sec.  A C4.1/Sf event occurred at 21/0557 UTC that had an associated Type II radio sweep (shock velocity estimated at 700 km/sec) and a Tenflare.  A 36 degree disappearing solar filament was observed at the beginning of the period that produced a CME which does not appear to be earth-directed.  Region 268 (N12E23) was also numbered today."

This region was the likely source of a large CME observed off the NE limb early on 6 March. Three other new sunspot groups emerged today and were numbered as 303 (S18W47), 304 (S13W16), and 305 (S22E27)."

The most likely source of this enhancement was a disappearing solar filament that lifted off near S25W55.  The western most 30 degrees of the large filament lifted off at 14/1730 UTC and was associated with a CME, as seen in LASCO imagery.  There is not enough data at the time of this report to determine if the CME will be geo-effective.  Two other DSFs occurred during the past twenty-four hours.  A 10 degree filament lifted off near S16W27 at 13/2030 UTC and a 13 degree filament lifted off near N40E45 at 13/2200 UTC.  The 13 degree DSF was associated with a CME off the northeast limb but does not appear to be Earth directed.  New Region 314 (S14E00) rapidly appeared on the visible disk and grew to 80 millionths.  Magnetic complexity of Region 314 also rapidly increased to a beta-gamma configuration."

All other data, including magnetometer, XRS x-ray measurements, and energetic particles, will have GOES 10 as their primary source, with GOES 12 as the secondary source where available. Please see http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html for important information on this changeover."

The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes were high levels early in the day but dropped below 1000 PFU after 0525 UTC.

Region 338 produced a very impulsive M7.0 x-ray flare at 26/0807Z. This region also produced an M2.1/1f flare at 26/0058Z and an M2.1/Sn flare at 26/0306Z along with multiple C-class events. The delta magnetic complex remains intact and penumbral coverage appears to be oscillating with this regions flare production. Region 344 (N16E13) has yet to produce any flare activity although the white-light penumbral coverage and the magnetic complexity of this region have shown rapid growth during the past 24 hours. Yesterday, this region was a simple beta complex which has since developed into a beta-gamma-delta magnetic structure.  Region 337 (S14W26) was quiescent through most of the period.  Regions 347 (S20E36), 348 (S36E58), and 349 (S14E60) were newly numbered today."

To ensure continued operational monitoring of important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) detectors. Beginning 1500 UT on May 15, GOES-8 will once again become the primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will be the primary satellite for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 will be the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray sensor, and energetic particle sensor. This short-term solution (approximately 2 - 3 months) will be in place until we define and implement a permanent fix. A more detailed explanation can be found at: http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html."

Region 375 continues to become more magnetically complex and maintains its delta magnetic configuration. This region has been responsible for the majority of events of this period.  However, Region 380 (S14E42) produced several C-class events and has increased in both white light area and sunspot count since yesterday.  New Region 381 (S18E19) was numbered today."

The activity increase was seen in response to a jump in solar wind velocity and density accompanied by a southward turning of Bz between 14/2100 UTC and 15/0100 UTC. Solar wind conditions remained elevated for the remainder of the day, ranging mostly between 550 to 600 km/s.

The solar wind signatures show the continued presence of a high speed coronal hole stream. In particular, the solar wind speed showed an increase around 0000 UTC up to about 700 km/s. The signature is consistent with the transition of the solar wind source from an isolated coronal hole in the western hemisphere to a southern polar extension coronal hole that crossed central meridian on 18 September.

The flare was accompanied by strong radio bursts, a type II radio sweep, and was associated with a coronal mass ejection. The CME was observed in LASCO-C2 off the northeast limb beginning at 1708 UTC with a plane-of-sky speed of about 500 km/s. Region 484 also produced two M1 flares: one at 0626 UTC, the other at 1926 UTC. The region also produced a C6/1f at 18/2218 UTC that was associated with a CME off the southeast limb around 18/2230 UTC. Neither of these CMEs appear to have any earthward directed component. Region 484 grew dramatically during the past 24 hours from 240 millionths at the start of the day to just over 1000 millionths by forecast issue time.

Severe storm levels persisted from 30/2100Z through 31/0900Z. Mostly active to major storm periods occurred through the latter half of the period. Solar radiation contamination on the ACE SWEPAM instrument finally ended at 31/0052Z. Solar wind speed was at an exceptionally high 1200 km/s, but has been in a gradual decline, ending the period at over 800 km/s. The prolonged periods of southward IMF Bz that occurred early in the period have ended. Bz has been mostly northward since 31/0200Z. The greater than 100 MeV proton event in progress since 28/1145Z, ended at 31/0145Z. This prolonged high energy proton event was actually two distinct events associated with the X17 and X10 flares on the 28th and 29th respectively. The peak measurements for both events were 186 pfu at 29/0015Z and 110 pfu at 29/2310Z. The greater than 10 MeV proton event remains in progress, but is quickly declining to the 10 pfu alert threshold. The two peak measurements at 10 MeV were 29,000 pfu at 29/0615Z and 3300 pfu at 30/1935Z. The PCA event has ended."

A pair of M3/2n flares were the most notable, peak fluxes were at 18/0752Z and 18/0831Z.  A filament channel to the south and west of this region erupted following the first flare.  Strong radio bursts, a Tenflare, a Type IV, and two separate occurrences of Type II radio sweeps were also associated with this period of activity.  LASCO imagery depicted a full halo CME as a result of the complex series of events that appears to have a fairly well connected Earth bound component to the plasma cloud.  This region has shown some growth over the past 24 hours and has emerged into a beta-gamma-delta magnetic complex.  The largest flare of the period was an M4 that occurred beyond the east limb at 18/1011Z and is thought to be from old Region 486 which should start to become visible on day one of the period.  Region 507 (N10E78) was newly numbered today and is believed to be old Region 488.  Region 506 (S23E72) was also numbered today."
