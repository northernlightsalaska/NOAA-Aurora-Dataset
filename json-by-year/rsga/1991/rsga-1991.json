THE SOURCE, SURPRISINGLY, WAS REGION 6495 (S03W83), ONE OF THE SIMPLEST GROUPS ON THE DISK (AREA 20 MILLIONTHS, CLASS BXO). REGION 6509 (S21E44) NOW DOMINATES THE DISK IN SIZE AT 1320 MILLIONTHS BUT ONLY PRODUCED A COUPLE FLARES, THE LARGEST A C7/1F AT 2207Z. REGION 6508 (S13E49) WHICH IS STACKED ON TOP OF 6509 IS ALSO QUITE IMPRESSIVE LOOKING BUT COULD ONLY PRODUCE A SUB- FLARE. SURGING AND INTENSE CALCIUM EMISSION WERE OBSERVED ON THE EAST LIMB TODAY AT S11, INDICATING THE IMMINENT RETURN OF OLD REGION 6471 WHICH PRODUCED 2 X-CLASS FLARES AND 10 M-CLASS FLARES ON ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT."

THE REGION SHOWED MODEST GROWTH AND IS CURRENTLY AN EAO BETA GROUP. REGION 6619 (N30E33) PRODUCED SEVERAL SMALL FLARES TODAY. THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE WAS A C6/SF AT 1841Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP. THE REGION DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE GROWING BUT DID SHOW SOME SPOT ROTATION AND IS MAINTAINING A DELTA CONFIGURATION IN A LARGE (1010 MILLIONTHS) PENUMBRAL MASS. REGION 6615 (S09W45), CONTINUED TO GROW AND IS THE LARGEST GROUP (1640 MILLTIOTHS) ON THE DISK. IT IS ALSO MAINTAINING ITS DELTA BUT HAD RELATIVELY COOL PLAGE AND COULD ONLY PRODUCE SMALL C-CLASS EVENTS TODAY."

THE EVENT HAD OUTSTANDING DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS AND A STRONG TYPE IV ASSOCIATED. THE GROUP ALSO PRODUCED AN M1 AT 2014Z. THE REGION CONSISTS OF A LARGE PRIMARY PENUMBRAL AREA OF ABOUT 1300 MIL- LIONTHS WITH A DELTA ON THE SOUTHEAST CORNER, THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE DRAMATIC FLARES SEEN SO FAR. THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY'S EVENTS CONSISTED OF A FEW SMALL C-CLASS EVENTS. NOTABLE GROWTH WAS OBSERVED IN NEW REGION 6667 (N12E37) AND GROWTH CONTINUES IN 6648 (S14W65). REGION 6652 (S10W48) HAS LOST ITS DELTA AND CONTINUES TO DECAY."

A CLEAR ENHANCEMENT OF THESE PARTICLES UP TO 94 PFU WAS OBSERVED AT 1535Z, COR- RESPONDING TO THE SHOCK EVENT MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR THE SHOCK EVENT AND SUBSEQUENT MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE IS THE X12+ FLARE OF 01 JUNE.
