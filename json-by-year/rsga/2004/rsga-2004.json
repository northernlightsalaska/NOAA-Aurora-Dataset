The enhancement consisted of an increase in total field and in solar wind velocity, and included some extended negative Bz intervals in the -1 to -10 nT range. Although the flow was somewhat atypical (low density, high temperature), the signatures appear to be consistent with a CME led by a compression wave and expanding in low density solar wind that originated in association with the M6 x-ray event on 5 January. The slow rotation of Bz from negative to positive during the last 18 hours resulted in a decrease in geomagnetic activity during the last 5-6 hours of the period. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes were high during the past 24 hours."

An initially unsettled geomagnetic field became more disturbed after 0600 UTC, with one minor storm period from 0600-0900 UTC, followed by unsettled to active conditions for the rest of the day. The increase was likely due to an observed change in the character of the solar wind around 0500 UTC. ACE solar wind data showed a slow rise in velocity, temperature, and density, as well as an increase in the total magnetic field intensity for about 4.5 hours accompanied by moderately southward Bz. The spiral angle also went through a reversal from away to towards just after 0600 Z and back from towards to away around 1000Z. This may be indicative of passage through an interplanetary current sheet. After 1000Z, velocity and speed continued to rise along with temperature, possibly suggestive of the onset of a co-rotating interaction region.

Soon after the eruption in Region 540, segments of the large circular filament in the northwest quadrant also erupted. Region 540 maintains a weak delta configuration in its trailing spots, but further decay in total area was also noted.

The second was a C1 at 0610 UTC from Region 542. All three of the currently spotted regions on the disk (542, 543, and 544 at N03W76) will be rotating around the west limb in the next 24 hours. A CME was observed by LASCO off the southeast limb, but the absence of disk activity strongly suggests a backside source for the event."

This region has recently rotated onto the visible solar disk and may have a weak gamma magnetic structure in the trailing portion of the sunspot cluster, currently analyzed as a beta group.  Region 551 (S06W14) continues to show steady growth in penumbral coverage and continued counter-clockwise rotation of the intermediate sunspots was evidenced once again during the interval. A single lesser B-class flare was the extent of flare activity in this region today.  Spotless active Region 553 (S04W38) managed to produce a C1 x-ray flare at 08/0452Z.

There is a significant distance between the lead and trailing sunspots (over 15 heliospheric degrees) although initial magnetic analysis suggest that all features associated to plague field are one region.  Region 567 (S12W55) produced two low level C-class flares early in the period.

Interestingly, a sudden impulse which was measured as 14 nT on the Boulder magnetometer occurred at 03/1414Z.  The transient may have been related to the full halo coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on 31 March.  Due to the SOHO/LASCO spacecraft maneuvers that were in progress at the end of March (no images were being retrieved) there is little certainty at this time as to whether this shock passage was the result of the full halo CME or related to other activity that preceded the long duration C3 event.

The event was reported in H-alpha imagery as a parallel ribbon flare with a small disappearing filament along the regions inversion line.  Several CME's were observed from the SOHO/LASCO imagery during the period, none of which seem to be Earth directed.  A full halo CME was first observed in C2 at 06/2006 UTC.

This region is in decay and much deterioration has been observed in the delta structure in the dominant trailing spot.  A second delta spot is evident just east of the dominate lead spot which has changed little since yesterday.  The spot area has decreased 140 millionths in white light observations.  Region 652 (N05E45) was also limited to low level C-class flare activity although SXI x-ray imagery indicates a near continuous surging in the northern quadrant of region continually bleeding off energy and possibly suppressing major flare activity.  The consensus of white light area coverage for this region is currently observed at over 1500 millionths with a well defined intermediate delta spot.  Region 653 (S14E45) has shown continued growth during the past 24 hours although it has been fairly quiescent throughout the period.  An eruptive prominence occurred at 19/0910Z on the west solar limb at S12 which produced a weak structured CME that does not appear to be Earth directed.

Region 672 (N05E33) produced an M4/2n long duration event with multiple flare centers that occurred at 12/0057Z and had an associated Type IV radio sweep, a Type II radio sweep (estimated shock velocity of 800 km/s), and a Tenflare of 2400 sfu.  SOHO/LASCO imagery was limited during the period but data indicates that a full halo CME resulted from the M4 x-ray flare and is expected to become geoeffective (see IIB). Region 672 underwent little change during the period in spot area and the region retains a beta-gamma magnetic classification.  Region 667 (S11W72) produced a M3/Sn very impulsive event (sympathetic flare from the M4 event based on SXI and Mauna Loa H-alpha data) at 12/0139Z that had an associated Type II radio sweep with an estimated shock velocity of 870 km/s.  The M3 flare also appears to have produced a CME that should merge with the previously mentioned CME.  This region remains a magnetically simply structured beta group.  No new regions were numbered today."

Region 691 (N14W25) grew quickly at the end of yesterday, and emerging flux near the leader spot fueled an instability that resulted in major flares. Chronologically, Region 691 produced: a C9/Sf with type II sweep at 0049UTC, an M3/Sf with type II at 0333UTC, an M4/Sf TENFLARE with types II and IV sweep at 0618UTC, an M3/1n with type II at 0928UTC, an X1/Sf (partially obscured by clouds) TENFLARE with types II and IV sweep at 1146UTC, and most recently an M5/Sn TENFLARE with type II sweep at 1633UTC. Numerous large (i.e., 9500 sfu at 245 MHz at 1413UTC) radio bursts occurred throughout the period. A paucity of LASCO observations made it difficult to discern if associated CMEs occurred, but there seems to be an indication that at least some CME activity did occur in conjunction with the latter flares. The region seems to still retain an amount of potency making additional significant activity likely. Elsewhere, Region 687 (N12W66) and Region 693 (S16E34) each had an occasional small C-class flare as both regions seemed to decay. New Region 695 (S16E68) was numbered."

The majority of the CME mass was observed over the northeast limb. Region 696 produced additional M-flares including an M1/1n at 0335 UTC (accompanied by type II and type IV sweeps and a bright, partial halo CME off the northeast limb), and an M1/Sf at 1826 UTC. The region has more than doubled in size, and of particular note is the emergence of positive polarity magnetic flux just ahead of the strong, negative polarity leader spots. The magnetic inversion between these parts of the group is driving the increased flare production and is close to becoming a magnetic delta configuration. Region 691 (N13W81) started producing flares again after a quiet day yesterday, including an M2/1f at 0133 UTC which was accompanied by a type II sweep. Region 693 (S15W18) continues to be the largest group on the disk but only managed to produce a C2/Sf at 0931 UTC.

A more recent M1 x-ray flare occurred at 31/1445Z from this region, and due to insufficient data, it is uncertain whether this flare produced a CME.
