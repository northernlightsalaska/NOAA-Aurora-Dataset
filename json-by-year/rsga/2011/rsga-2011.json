The Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field turned south coincident with the increase in solar wind speed, temperature, and density.  These events suggest the arrival of a corotating interaction region between 01/05-12Z in advance of a coronal hole high speed stream.  Bz  averaged -10 nT for several hours, bringing two periods of minor storm levels at middle latitudes."

Region 1171 is a spotless plage region which produced an M1 event at 08/0358Z with a non-earth directed CME off the east limb, and an associated Type II and Type IV radio sweep.  Region 1165 (S18W92) produced an M5/1f flare at 08/1044Z.  This region, along with Regions 1164 (N23W71) and 1166 (N11W01) continue to maintain their Beta-Gamma-Delta magnetic configuration.  The SOHO/LASCO and STEREO imagery have observed several CMEs over the past 24 hours from Regions 1164 and 1165.  After further analysis from yesterday, there was an associated fast halo CME correlated with the M3 event at 07/2012Z which was determined to be earth directed.  Region 1165 has an M1 event in progress at this report time which started at 08/1946Z.  The Penticton 10.7 cm flux and the 90 day mean are estimated for today (08 March) due to flare enhanced readings."

Associated with this LDE was a partial-halo CME, first observed in LASCO C2 imagery at 16/1912Z. A preliminary plane-of-sky estimate indicated a velocity near 500 km/s. The region maintained its beta-gamma magnetic classification as it approached the west limb. New Region 1173 (S28E39) emerged on the disk as a bi-polar C-type group. The Penticton 10.7 cm flux and the 90-day mean are estimated for today (16 March) due to flare enhanced readings."

Associated with this event were Type II (673 km/s), Type IV and 10.7 cm (170 sfu) radio signatures. Region 1176 remained mostly unchanged through the period, though it increased in longitudinal extent, and is classified as an F-type group. Region 1178 (S15E43) developed penumbra in its trailer spots to become a D-type group. At about 26/0500Z, GOES-15 SXI BE12A imagery observed a large surge from Region 1180 (N25E53) that appeared to continue for about six hours. X-ray data was mostly unavailable during this event due to GOES-13 and GOES-15 eclipse phase. Associated with this event was a fast-moving (approximately 850 km/s) partial-halo, asymmetric CME first observed in LASCO C3 imagery at 26/0630Z and STEREO-A and B COR2 imagery at 26/0709Z. Though this CME does not appear to have an Earth-directed component, further analysis is required."

Associated with this event was a CME, first observed in LASCO C2 and C3 imagery at 27/0200Z and 27/0242Z respectively. The CME appeared as a narrow band extending east, as viewed in LASCO, and had an estimated plane-of-sky velocity of 630 km/s. SDO/AIA 193 imagery indicated material movement in a wide band extending north through east with stronger movement in an easterly direction. Region 1176 showed little change during the period. At 27/0511Z, Type II (estimated shock velocity of 651 km/s) and Type IV radio signatures were observed. GOES13 and 15 were in eclipse phase, so GOES XRS data was not available. At 27/0512Z, limited GOES-15 SXI data indicated surging and material movement off the NE limb in the vicinity of new Region 1183 (N15E62). LASCO C2 (27/0536Z) and C3 (27/0606Z) imagery detected an asymmetric, partial-halo CME lifting off the NE limb with an estimated plane-of-sky velocity of 880 km/s. New Region 1183 rotated on as a large, 8-spot E-type group with beta-gamma magnetic characteristics. New Region 1182 (N13E01) evolved on the disk as a single spot unipolar group. The remaining groups were quiet and stable during the period. At this time, neither CMEs observed on 27 March appeared to have an Earth-directed component. The Penticton 10.7 cm flux and 90 day mean are estimated due to non-receipt of 27 Marchs flux reading."

There was not any indication of a CME associated with either of these events. Region 1195 dominated the activity during the past 24 hours and produced numerous additional C-class x-ray events. The group showed steady growth throughout the period and is currently estimated to have 370 millionths sunspot area. The group also shows some magnetic complexity (Beta-Gamma); particularly interesting is an east-west section of the inversion line in the center of the group which has a favorable configuration for building shear.

New Region 1233 (S18W29) was numbered as a unipolar spot group. No significant changes were observed with the remaining regions on the disk. During the period, LASCO C3 and STEREO-B COR2 imagery observed three separate CMEs. The first two CMEs were back-sided, and appeared to originate from the vicinity of old Region 1222 (N17, L=160) which rotated off the visible disk on 31 May. CME number one was first observed in STEREO Ahead EUVI 195 imagery at 04/0645Z and later in LASCO C3 imagery at 04/2212Z as a partial-halo CME lifting of the east limb. The plane-of-sky speed was estimated at about 1380 km/s. CME number two was first observed in STEREO Ahead EUVI 195 imagery at 04/2145Z and later in LASCO C3 imagery at 05/0733ZZ as an asymmetric full-halo CME lifting off the east limb. The plane-of-sky speed for this CME was estimated at about 2160 km/s. A third CME originated from an eruptive, 16 degree filament centered near N34E37. The filament was first observed lifting off in SDO/AIA 193 imagery at 05/0341Z, with the partial-halo CME first visible in STEREO Behind COR2 imagery at 05/0733Z.

The Bz component remained strongly southward through about 05/0000Z where it turned strongly northward to about +18 nT through 05/0700Z.

The region showed little change over the past 24 hours. Region 1234 (S16W29) produced low-level B-class activity during the period. The region showed modest growth in spot count. Two low-level C-class x-ray events were observed from a region behind the east limb near S17. These events most likely originated from old Region 1223 (S17, L=130). A 10 degree eruptive filament, centered near S23W35, was observed lifting off just SW of Region 1234. Filament movement was first observed on SDO/AIA 193 imagery at 16/1426Z with a subsequent narrow CME off the SW limb, first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 16/1612Z.

The X-ray event was associated with a Sf flare from Region 1236 (N17W21) as well as the eruption of a 17 degree filament near N39W01. Also associated with this activity was a symmetric halo CME which first entered the SOHO C2 coronagraph field of view at 0316Z and had an estimated plane of sky speed of about 640 km/s. Region 1236 was generally unchanged during the past 24 hours and is the dominant spot group on the disk. The other spotted regions were very small and appeared to be decaying."

From 1800-2100Z, minor to severe storm levels dominated.  Solar wind data from ACE showed a shock-like feature passing ACE at 04/2105Z which was followed by a 20 nT sudden impulse at 04/2155Z.  The solar phi angle showed rotation from negative to positive between 0300-1400Z. An additional shock passage was seen at ACE at 1722Z followed by a noticeable increase in solar wind density, velocity and magnetic field.  An additional enhancement in the solar wind parameters was observed at 1834Z which include Bz fluctuation to -20 nT.  Although the interpretation is not yet certain, timing analysis and model simulation suggest that the 1722Z & 1834Z enhancements are the first two of the three expected CME passages.  GOES 15 observed magnetopause crossings between 1900Z-1915Z and 2000Z-2030Z.  GOES 13 also observed magnetopause crossings between 2000Z-2030Z.

The region showed penumbral development in the trailer spots and was classified as a D-type, bi-polar spot group. Region 1282 (N25W40) indicated an increase in area and longitudinal extent and was classified as an E-type, bi-polar spot group. A CME was observed lifting off the SE limb, first seen in SOHO LASCO/C2 imagery at 02/0748Z. A plane-of-sky speed was estimated at 375 km/s. The source of this CME appears to have originated from a filament channel centered near S28E42. Material motion was first observed on SDO/AIA 193 imagery at 02/0554Z.

This event originated from the west limb spot group complex consisting of Regions 1280 (N13W91) and 1286 (N20W75). Close proximity to the limb made precise analysis of the flare location difficult. Associated with the M3 event was a west limb CME, first observed in LASCO C2 imagery at 04/1212Z. A plane-of-sky speed was estimated at about 400 km/s. Preceding this event was another west limb CME, first observed in LASCO C2 imagery at 04/0912Z. A plane-of-sky speed was estimated at about 150 km/s.  Analysis of the potential geoeffectiveness of these CMEs is ongoing. Numerous C-class flares were also observed during the period from this area of the west limb. Region 1287 (S32E51) produced a C1 x-ray event early in the period at 03/2212Z. This region showed minor growth in area while the remaining regions on the disk indicated a slight decay in area coupled with loss of spots."

IMF Bt reached 20 nT.  Wind velocities increased from a steady 350 km/s to 525 km/s and remained so through the end of the period.  This mostly likely was the arrival of a CME that occurred at 22/0058Z in association with an eruptive filament.  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began at 23/1500Z ended at 23/1605Z.  A peak flux of 13 pfu was reached at 23/1535Z.  Earlier in the period, another, weaker shock passage was observed in the ACE solar wind data at 23/2320Z.  This was most likely the result of a glancing blow from a CME associated with an M1.6 x-ray event observed of the NW limb at 20/0325Z ."

A CME was observed in the LASCO C2 coronagraph beginning at about 0812Z but was confirmed to be from the backside using STEREO imagery."

An increase to unsettled to active levels with some minor storm periods at high latitudes occurred after 1003Z after a disturbance in the solar wind impacted the magnetosphere. The disturbance was also seen at the ACE spacecraft at about 0855Z: solar wind increased from around 280 km/s to about 320 km/s, Bt from 3 nT up to about 6 nT, and density from less than 1 p/cc up to about 6 p/cc. The solar wind parameters continued to show somewhat elevated signatures for the remainder of the period. There was also a solar sector boundary crossing on 29 October at about 2111Z from negative to positive polarity and the presence of a positive sector was clearly indicated throughout the interval. In addition, solar wind speed and temperature were showing an increasing trend near the end of the interval. It appears that the initial phase of the disturbance was related to the DSF/CME that occurred on 26 October. However, it also appears that the expected high speed stream is beginning to be evident in the solar wind observations."

The other two M flares were an M1 at 1121Z and another M1 at 2038Z. Region 1339 continues to be the dominant group on the disk but showed a slight decrease in area and magnetic complexity. Nonetheless the group is still large (about 1190 millionths) and still has at least two magnetic delta configurations. New Region 1340 (S09E61) was assigned and is a simple H-type sunspot group. White light imagery from SDO show two significant spot groups rotating around east limb at about 9 degrees north and 17 degrees north. These are assigned NOAA Region numbers 1341 and 1342 respectively. The proximity of these regions to the limb makes it difficult to assess their size and complexity at this time."

Region 1348 was responsible for two C-flares overnight; the largest was a C5/Sf at 14/0930Z.  Associated with this event was a Type II radio sweep with an estimated plane-of-sky velocity of 610 km/sec.  Possible decay was noted in the trailing spots of Regions 1339 (N19W89) and 1344 (S17W86) as they are rotating off of the west limb.  There was growth noted in the trailing spots of Region 1341 (N09W35). A slight amount of consolidation was observed in Region 1347 (N07E28).  The additional three new flux regions were assigned numbers 1349 (N15W02), 1350 (N26E67), and 1351 (S23E51).  A coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed in LASCO C3 imagery at approximately 12/1906Z off of the east limb.  The plane-of-sky velocity was calculated to be 638 km/sec.  An additional CME was observed in LASCO C3 imagery at 13/1930Z from the north limb.  Neither CME is expected to become geoeffective."

Region 1387 continues to grow, in areal coverage and magnetic complexity as it rotates into a more geoeffective location. Region 1386 (S17E37) also continues to grow and evolve. A proton enhancement at geosynchronous orbit was observed by the GOES 13 spacecraft, with a max flux of 3 pfu at 26/0135. This enhancement appears to be correlated to the M4/1n flare from Region 1387 on 25 December. Protons were again at background level at the time of this report. Over the past 36 hours, 5 CMEs have been observed in STEREO and LASCO C2 and C3 imagery. Three CMEs were associated with eruptive filaments and two were associated with flares from Region 1387.
