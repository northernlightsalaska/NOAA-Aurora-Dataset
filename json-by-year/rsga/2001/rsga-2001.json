Region 9384 (N11W23) also produced a number of small C-class subflares. Both Regions exhibited flare-bright plage fluctuations throughout the day. A full halo CME was reported by the SOHO LASCO team as being first observed in the LASCO C2 instrument at 16/0350 UTC. Timing of the event suggests that it is most likely associated with an eruptive filament between Regions 9373 and 9384. Small C-class flares also occurred in these Regions during this time period."

Region 9393 (N18W82) produced a spectacular flare beginning at 02/2132Z, reaching maximum at 02/2151Z and ending at 02/2203Z: the peak of the event saturated the GOES-XRS sensors, but was estimated to be X20, the largest observed so far this solar cycle. A fast coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed in association with this event. The CME appeared to be primarily headed off the west limb, but there was a deflection of material near the north polar region, suggesting that the event trajectory might have some earthward component. In the LASCO-C3 coronagraph images, this CME was overtaking the previous CME associated with yesterday's X-class event from the same region. Region 9393 also produced an M2/2f flare at 1234Z. The leading spots of 9393 are currently rotating off the solar disk. Newly assigned region 9415 (S22E72) produced an X1/1n flare at 0357Z. The event was also associated with a CME which has the signature of a partial halo event, although the bulk of the material appears to be flowing in a southeasterly direction. So far Region 9415 is showing three large penumbral clusters with an area of about 470 millionths. Solar observers report that additional spots are rotating into view behind this leading section of the region. Two new regions emerged on the disk today: Region 9416 (N17W18) and Region 9417 (S10E43). Region 9408 (S08W46) showed some growth during the past 24 hours but was relatively stable."

The response is less certain than in the case of a full-halo CME and probably less dramatic than the result of a direct, head-on hit. The forecast is for minor storm levels at the mid-latitudes, with major storm levels at the higher latitudes. Minor storm conditions are expected to persist through the second day. Additional activity, most likely reaching active levels, is possible on the third day due to a glancing blow from the CME from region 9415.

After the shock the solar wind displayed high speeds and strong fluctuations of the magnetic component Bz (peak values were around +/- 20 nT). This disturbed solar wind produced active to minor storm levels of geomagnetic activity. Bz stabilized into a steady northward orientation around 1830Z and  geomagnetic activity levels seemed to be calming in response. The shock and subsequent enhanced solar wind flow are most likely to have been produced by the combined drivers from CMEs out of region 9393 on April 2.

Region 9415 is the dominant region on the disk with 820 millionths area in an Eko, beta-gamma-delta configuration. The only other solar flares of note today were a few C-class subflares. Coronagraph data also showed that yesterday's CME, associated with the long-duration M5 event, could be classified as a full-halo event. Nonetheless the sequence of images give the impression that the center of the CME is not headed directly at the Earth.

All of this region appears to have rotated onto the disk and is presently seen as a moderately-sized (700 millionths) F-type sunspot group with some mixed polarities. This area also produced a few small C-class subflares during the day. Interestingly, a CME was visible entering the SOHO/LASCO/C2 field of view over the northwest limb shortly after the M2 at about 19/1200 UTC. The location suggests that departed Region 9415 was involved with this activity but any connection to the M2 discussed above may only be coincidental.

There were no observations of corresponding disk activity, but there was a CME just behind the Northwest limb of the Sun that could be reasonably associated with the event. The other was a C6 with start-max-end times of 1448-1519-1547 UTC: newly assigned Region 9454 (N15E74) was seen to brighten in H-alpha during the event, and a CME became visible on the East limb in C2 observations at 1530 UTC.

Region 9454 (N13W08) also displayed a small degree of magnetic complexity, but was stable through the period. Region 9458 (S12W72) produced a C2/Sf flare at 16/1550 UTC as it approached the west limb. This flare was associated with a Type II radio sweep and a CME, which did not appear to be Earth-directed. Region 9461 (N16E63), which was the return of old Region 9433 (responsible for major flares during it previous two rotations), was relatively stable during the period.

EIT imagery shows that this event originated over the southwestern limb and was probably from Region 9455 (S17W90+). An impressive coronal mass ejection (CME) in conjunction with the flare can be seen on images from the LASCO/SOHO spacecraft. The CME appears to be non earth-directed. An M1 flare with an accompanying Type II radio sweep (1088 km/s) was detected at 20/0920 UTC. This event was most likely a backside event from the same region as the previously described M6 event. Region 9463 (N09E46) nearly doubled in size and spot count overnight and also developed into a more complex sunspot group classification (14 spot, Eko-Beta).

Another event of note occurred in spotless Region 9474 (N22W64) at 04/1633 UTC, when a C3/Sf flare and associated Type-II radio sweep was observed, along with a small, nearby  filament disappearance.  Some enhancement in 10MeV proton flux was observed following this event, indicating a well-connected location for this activity, though not expected to result in a proton event.  CME activity was observed in association with today's events, but not appearing earth-directed."

The CME was directed mostly to the southeast but a portion of it appeared to cross the solar south pole. Region 9502 is not showing growth, but it does have an east-west inversion line and continues to produce occasional flares. A subsequent impressive CME was observed on the west limb in LASCO/C2 images at beginning at 1648 UTC. There were no obvious disk or x-ray signatures, implying that the CME originated from behind the west limb.

Impulsive B- and C-class flares were observed throughout the period, the largest being an optically uncorrelated C3 flare at 16/0957 UTC.  However, the most impressive activity of the day was a remarkable backside CME, observed on SOHO/LASCO starting at about 15/2355 UTC.  This event resulted in the proton enhancements discussed in section IIA below.  The observed CME together with backside imagery inferred from the SOHO/MDI instrument suggest old Region 9557 (S20, L=283) as the likely source, presently located near the far backside central meridian.  On the visible disk, three new regions were numbered today:  9583 (S23E13), 9584 (S11E60), and 9585 (N15E74).  All appear to be small, simply structured beta-class groups with low flare activity potential."

This region also produced occasional, impulsive low- to mid-level C-class flares during the period. Region 9591 continued to rotate into view as the day progressed and is now classed as a moderate-sized F-type spot group. Limb proximity prevented a detailed analysis of this region's magnetic structure, but recent activity suggests at least a moderate degree of magnetic complexity.

Since 04/1500Z, the X-ray baseline ranged from C4 - C8 with occasional fluctuations to the M1 level. Development within regions near the SE limb, the SW limb and within Region 9601 (N13W22) are the likely sources of the enhanced X-rays. Region 9606 (S17E45) produced an impulsive M1/1n at 04/2017Z. Region 9601, at almost 800 millionths of white light area is moderately complex and the largest region on the visible disk. Several plage fluctuations were observed in this region, but only minor C-class flareS were observed. The two M-class flares observed yesterday at 03/1545Z and 03/1841Z were likely associated with CMEs off the SE limb. New region 9607 (S16E68) was numbered today."

It should be noted, however, that Region 9628 (S18W37) was undergoing frequent plage brightenings during the course of the event and may also have been a contributor. Region 9628 showed slight decay today, but continues to possess strong magnetic fields, including a delta near the center of the region. Region 9632 (S19W21) also continues to look impressive with a strong delta across an east-west inversion line. In spite of their size and complexity, none of the flares observed from these regions exceeded the subfaint level. Region 9634 (N12E11) showed some growth today as did Region 9637 (S14E32).

Several Type III radio sweeps and discrete frequency radio bursts made up the rest of today's activity.  The partial halo CME seen on EIT imagery yesterday appears to have been caused by a back-side source.  Region 9636 and Region 9641 (S13W19) both showed an increase area coverage of their respective spot coverage today.  Three new groups were numbered today, Region 9651 (S22W12), Region 9652 (N22E14), and Region 9653 (S23E76).  Region 9653 has a penumbral spot that can be seen rotating onto the east limb and has a latitude of that in which old Region 9608 had as it departed the west limb."

Preliminary analysis of 9687 indicates at least a beta-gamma magnetic class, and there may possibly be a weak delta sunspot in the group. Region 9684 (N05W15) showed some spot rotation and some development of the leader spot. A partial halo CME, reported by LASCO, entered the C2 field of view at 01/2230 UTC and was apparently associated with yesterday's M1 event out of Region 9682."

The event was accompanied by strong radio bursts, a type II sweep, and a type IV sweep. A CME was observed to enter the C2 field of view during the flare, with the leading edge just visible at 1635 UTC. The front edge moved quickly across C2 and exited somewhere between 1655 UTC and 1705 UTC. Region 9684 has grown and the leader and trailer spots merged during the past 24 hours, making the region a beta-gamma-delta group. Region 9687 (S20E35) continues to be a complex, beta-gamma group and produced a few C-class subflares. Region 9682 (N13W64) is still the largest group on the disk but could only muster a couple of subflares. A 10 degree filament just west of Region 9684 disappeared sometime between 03/2208 UTC and 04/0629 UTC."

This region remained the largest and most complex on the disk with an area exceeding 1400 millions of the visible disk. It continued to grow in area and complexity with multiple magnetic delta configurations and strong magnetic field gradients. Region 9687 (S20W31) produced a long-duration M1/Sf flare at 09/1841 UTC associated with weak Type II and IV radio sweeps and minor centimetric radio bursts. This region remained moderate in size and magnetic complexity with some polarity mixing evident in its leader spots, but showed no significant changes. Region 9692 (N06W39) showed significant growth during the period, but produced no flares. It remained simply-structured. Region 9684 (N06W95) rotated out of view. No new regions were numbered."

An associated 630 sfu tenflare and Type-II radio sweep (estimated velocity 890 km/s) were also observed, and an energetic proton flux enhancement was in progress, but below threshold, at the end of the period.  This event also produced a greatly enhanced 10cm noon flux observation of 283 sfu, so the morning value of 190 sfu was substituted to better represent the background flux for the period.  The source region for this event (Region 9698) is particularly remarkable, after having decayed to its present alpha magnetic configuration (a single Hsx spot, with 110 millionths areal coverage), following ten days on the visible disk without any other optical or x-ray activity observed.  Region 9704 (S18W38) also produced an M-class event, a M1/1f flare at 22/1708 UTC.  Two new regions were numbered today:  9713 (N08E03) and 9714 (S11E36)."

The shock passages enhanced the already high 10 MeV proton integral flux to a peak value of 18900 pfu at 24/0555 UTC.  Severe storm conditions were evident in planetary K-index values during 24/0600-1800 UTC.  This event is the likely result of interaction among up to three interplanetary shock propagations from separate CME events during 21-23 November, indicated by re-analysis of shock arrival model predictions with improved event velocity data. Results suggest that the CMEs may have merged into the single interplanetary shock that passed the earth today.  The 10 MeV proton event and associated polar cap absorption remained in progress at the end of the period, however the 100 MeV proton event ended at 24/1200 UTC."

Region 9733 (N14E44) is the other region of note on the disk: the group has more clearly rotated into view with a beta-gamma magnetic configuration and produced a couple C-class subflares during the day. A seventeen degree filament near N39E24 disappeared sometime between 0116 UTC and 0545 UTC."

Region 9733 continues to maintain its size and magnetic complexity. Region 9727 (S21W77) also remained active during the period, producing one M-class flare and several optical subflares. An M3 flare with an associated Type II radio sweep (approx. velocity of 707 km/s), and an impressive CME was observed at 14/0913 UTC. The originating source appears to be just beyond the east limb as loop prominences were visible on the east limb at N06, from 14/0938 to 1035 UTC. The resulting CME is primarily eastward directed and should not be geoeffective.

        "text": "to 16/2100Z:  Solar activity increased to moderate levels. Region 9733 (N14W36) remained the most active sunspot group on the disk. It produced two M-class flares: an M1/2N at 16/0124 UTC and an M1/1f at 16/0328 UTC. Minor radio emission accompanied both flares. Region 9733 decreased slightly in area and magnetic complexity and appeared to lose the magnetic delta configuration within its northernmost spots. However, it retained a moderately complex beta-gamma magnetic classification. Region 9739 (S13W43) appeared to be in a gradual growth phase, but remained simply structured. Region 9742 (N08E64) produced isolated subflares during the period. Magnetogram images suggest this region may possess a moderate degree of magnetic complexity, though it is difficult to gauge given its limb proximity. New Region 9743 (S10E73) produced isolated subflares as it rotated into view. It may represent the return of old Region 9714 (S08, L = 195), which produced M-class flares during its last rotation. New Region 9744 (S06E24) was also numbered."

This impressive X3.4 east limb event (located near S23) was accompanied by a 1600 sfu tenflare, type-II radio sweeps, and bright post-flare loops visible in H-alpha and EIT imagery for several hours following the event.  A large CME was also evident in LASCO imagery, with an estimated plane-of-sky velocity reported at 2170 km/s. Other activity included a west limb CME, with an M9.3 x-ray enhancement peaking at 29/0945 UTC, and associated type-II and type-IV radio sweeps.  An associated subfaint optical flare was also observed from Region 9748 (S11W90), but is presumed to be only a sympathetic indicator of the bulk of the activity from an apparent nearby source region behind the west limb.  Several other M-class flares occurred throughout the period, though most were optically uncorrelated and presumed to be from limb sources, except for an M1/1f from Region 9751 (N04W38) at 29/0545 UTC."

This region is the likely source of the X-class flare and CME activity of 28 December, and has now rotated into view.  The region appears to be of significant size and magnetic complexity, but is current location near the east limb prevents a full analysis of it's characteristics.  Other activity during the same period included a long duration M1 x-ray enhancement during 29/1950-2355 UTC, with an associated west limb CME evident in LASCO imagery, though appearing to lack any significant earth-directed component. Other regions on the visible disk were mostly quiescent, with a few minor C-class events observed.  An additional new region was also numbered today, Region 9766 (N05E62)."

Late in the period, an additional shock passage was observed at the ACE satellite at 30/1932 UTC, followed by a sudden impulse of 27 nT observed at Boulder at 30/2010 UTC.  This event is presumed to be an early arrival of effects from the powerful X-class event of 28 December. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at geosynchronous orbit has fluctuated near the event threshold value of 10 pfu for most of the day, though now appears to be undergoing some enhancement due to the recent shock passage.
