An initially quiet field became disturbed after 0500Z due to an extended period of southward interplanetary magnetic field. Active to minor storm levels were observed initially but there was a strong substorm interval from 0800-1000Z which increased the level to major storm at some mid-latitude stations and severe storm at some high latitude sites. Conditions have been at active to minor storm levels since 1000Z. Solar wind signatures appear to be most consistent with a solar sector boundary crossing, which was also seen 27 days ago during the last solar rotation.

        "text": "to 30/2100Z:  Solar activity was very low.  New Region 933 (S04E78) produced several low level B-flares.  The largest was a B3 flare at 30/0240Z.  A slow moving CME from the west limb was first observed on LASCO imagery at 29/2130Z, with an estimated plane of sky speed of 181 km/s.  This was likely associated with a disappearing solar filament centered near S20W59.  A possible glancing blow from this westward-directed CME may arrive beyond the forecast period."
