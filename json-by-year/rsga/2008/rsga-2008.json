ACE real-time solar wind data show a slow increase in solar wind speeds at the beginning of the period followed by a marked increase in speed and temperature around 0400Z. The magnetic field observations at ACE also indicate a gradual increase as well as an extended period of mostly southward Bz from 0200Z to about 1700Z. The signatures are consistent with a co-rotating interaction region followed by a high speed solar wind stream. Solar wind speed remains elevated with values around 640 km/s at forecast issue time."
