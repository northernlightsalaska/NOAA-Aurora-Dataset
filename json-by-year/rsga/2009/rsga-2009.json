The largest of these was a B8 at 0437Z. The group grew rapidly and is currently a D type sunspot region with an area of about 140 millionths. The magnetic analysis showed a beta group with a single, East-West oriented polarity inversion line. The frequency and intensity of flare activity from the region appeared to be decreasing slightly during the last four hours of the period. The remainder of the solar disk was quiet and stable."
