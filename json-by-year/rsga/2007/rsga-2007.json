However, a weak shock was seen at ACE at 1054Z, followed by an increase in magnetic field strength and density as well as a small increase in velocity. There were some extended intervals of southward Bz and as a result there was a period of minor to major storm level activity from 1500-1800Z. Conditions declined to active to minor storm levels for remainder of the period (1800-2100Z). Although the observations are not yet conclusive the disturbance appears to be from a transient structure in the solar wind, rather than from a recurrent structure. The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels during the past 24 hours."
