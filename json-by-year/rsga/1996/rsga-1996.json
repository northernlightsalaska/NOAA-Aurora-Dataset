TWO MEDIUM SIZED SPOTS WITH PENUMBRA CONSTITUTE MOST OF THE 120 MILLIONTHS AREA OF THE GROUP. BOTH THESE SPOTS ARE MOSTLY POSITIVE POLARITY, BUT THE 'TRAILER' HAS A WEAK DELTA CONFIGURATION DUE TO A SMALL SECTION OF NEGATIVE POLARITY PENUMBRA IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SPOT. MOST OF THE GROWTH AND ACTIVITY IN THIS GROUP, HOWEVER, IS OCCURRING TO THE EAST OF THE BIG SPOTS, IN A SECTION OF WEAKER BUT MORE SHEARED MAGNETIC FIELDS. A HIGH-LATITUDE, REVERSE POLARITY SPOT GROUP (NUMBERED 7963) EMERGED TODAY NEAR N25E42 AS A SIMPLE B-TYPE REGION. THE LOCATION AND MAGNETIC CHARACTER IF THE GROUP STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT IT IS A NEW CYCLE SUNSPOT REGION."

The data base was not restarted until August 19. During that time, the Outside User Systems (OUS) products could not update. Products issued since the data base recovered are being updated.  The products missed between August 16-19 are still not available but should be restored over the next several days. These products will not be automatically emailed to majordomo customers. If you cannot access the missed products through the OUS Gopher or FTP please let us know and we will email them to you.  We are sorry for the inconvenience this caused many of our customers.  If we can be of further assistance please call.  Sincerely,   Viola Raben vraben@sec.noaa.gov  Larry E. Combs (303) 497-5299 lcombs@sec.noaa.gov"

Samples of the old and new formats are shown below.  In general, the changes add header and information lines with a unique beginning character: o  A \"#\" in the first column indicates a header line o  A \":\" n the first column indicates a key-word line. The key-word between the colons is followed by some information All products and listings will have two addtional lines: its name and issue date.  THERE ARE NO FORMAT CHANGES WITHIN THE PRODUCTS only to the header lines.   !!!!!!!  The new formats will begin sometime after Dec 11th.  !!!!!!!  Products initially effected: Alert and Warning Messages RSGA - the \"Forecast\" - Report of Solar and Geophysical Activity SRS  - Solar Region Summary SGAS - Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary SCDR - Solar Coronal Disturbance Report GEOA - GEOALERT WWV  - The Geophysical Alert Message Weekly Highlights and Forecast Weekly 27-day Outlook  SEC Services effected: Majodomo List Server World-wide web (only products in/from the Gopher/ftp directories) Gopher ftp  Update on other SEC changes: The new software to move us off the old database machine is scheduled to be installed beginning December 16th. While these changes will not effect the product format or contain, they may cause disturbtions in service. Please bear with us during this transition.  We apologize for the inconvience these changes will cause our customers, espically those who have developed software to decode our products. Again, these are changes to the header line only, the product format do NOT change. Our objectives are to: o standardize our products, o provide additional information with each product, o improve the reliabilities of our services, o establish format conventions for upcoming, new products.  Please send questions and comments to Viola Raben at vraben@sec.noaa.gov or (303) 497-5691.   Sincerely,  Viola Raben Space Environment Center   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ SAMPLE OLD FORMAT  Prepared jointly by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Space Environment Center and the U.S. Air Force.   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ SAMPLE NEW FORMAT :Product: RSGA :Issued: 1996 Dec 9 2210UT # Prepared jointly by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, # Space Environment Center and the U.S. Air Force. #"
