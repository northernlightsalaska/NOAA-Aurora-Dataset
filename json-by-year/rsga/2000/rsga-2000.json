        "text": "The geomagnetic field varied from unsettled to major storm levels, due to a prolonged period of negative Bz accompanied by moderate solar wind speed.  Greatest activity occurred during 14/0900-1800 UTC, which saw two periods of storming at minor levels in middle latitudes, and at major levels in higher latitudes.  Possible sources of this activity include extended effects of the 09 October CME passage, which commenced yesterday, or trailing effects from a weaker LDE C-flare that occurred about 30 hours after the CME."

An associated full halo (with faint east limb extension) was also reported by SOHO/LASCO.  Prior to this event, a weaker LDE C7 flare was observed at 16/0549UT.  Optical correlation was not available, but EIT imagery suggests the likely source as Region 9193 (N06W74).  This region also produced a C1/Sf at 16/2020UT.

The solar wind following the shock did not exhibit strongly southward fields, and the result was a weaker disturbance than had been expected, with a decline to active to unsettled during the last nine hours of the period. This shock most likely is the result of the CME associated with the M7 flare of 8 November, and the solar wind signatures are consistent with an interpretation that the Earth received a glancing, rather than a direct blow from the interplanetary disturbance. Event level proton fluxes continued today at the greater than 10 MeV and 100 MeV levels. Flux levels declined throughout the period, with current levels (as of 10/2100Z) of 192 pfu and 1.3 pfu at 10 MeV and 100 MeV respectively."

Reports of strong doppler shifts in the NE-SW filament in Region 9240 (N08E34) were soon followed by an impressive eruption at 25/0131Z. The eruption included an M8/2N, long duration ribbon flare with strong radio bursts including a 14000 sfu Tenflare. Strong Type II and IV sweeps also occurred with this flare and a CME was observed on LASCO imagery. Region 9236 flared again, producing an M3/2n flare and CME at 25/0920Z. The period ended with an X1/2b from Region 9236 with moderate to strong radio bursts and Type II sweep (910km/s). It appears that yet another Earth-directed CME was associated with this event.

This region also produced several elevated C-class events throughout the day, and exhibits notable growth in spot count, areal coverage, and magnetic complexity since yesterday.  Region 9280 (N09E80) remains the largest spot group on the disk, and also shows some increase in magnetic complexity, though did not produce any notable flare activity today.  Two new regions were numbered: 9285 (N06E59) and 9286 (N30W47), with the former a source of some subfaint C-class flare activity."
