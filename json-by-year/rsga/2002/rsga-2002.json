Two new regions rotated into view: 9829 (S07E74), a small C-type group, and 9830 (S22E73), a small H-type group. Numerous CMEs were observed in LASCO imagery today. Of these, a CME that was first seen in C2 at 14/0254 UTC was associated with disk activity in EIT in the southwest quadrant, and appears to have at least some earthward component."

Also associated with this event were a type IV sweep and a halo CME visible in LASCO imagery. Region 9866 continues to decay slowly. C-class flare activity was observed from Region 9870 (S20W39) which appears to have some new, opposite polarity flux emergence. Region 9871 (S19E07) produced a C8/1f flare at 1918 UTC and is currently the largest region on the disk."

The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began at 21/0225 UTC continued (peak 2520 pfu at 21/2320 UTC). The greater than 10 MeV flux at the close of the period was around 110 pfu."

This event was associated with a filament eruption, Type II sweep, and a CME visible in LASCO images that was apparently directed towards the northwest. CME material was also seen directed towards the southeast but preliminary analysis suggests that this may be related to a separate event, possibly from beyond the east limb. Region 9934 (S17E48) remains the largest and most complex sunspot group on the disk and is currently a moderately-large E-type group with a delta configuration in the leader spot complex. This region has produced flares during the past day but none of them have had significant x-ray output. New Regions 9937 (S09E68) and 9938 (S04E72) are rotating onto the disk."

Region 9957 (N09E22) continues to be the largest group on the disk and has a delta configuration in a compact collection of spots.

The flare was associated with a CME from the northeast limb. This event was followed by a long duration C9/1f flare from Region 9948 (S21W84) which began at 21/2314 UTC, reached maximum at 22/0030 UTC, and ended at 22/0128 UTC. This event was associated with a CME from the southwest limb. Subsequent to this was another long-duration event, a C5/Sf (maximum time at 0354) from the eruption of a long, north-south filament just east of 9948 (near S22W53). This flare showed classic parallel ribbons in H-alpha and was associated with a very fast, spectacular looking full-halo CME. The plane-of-sky velocity was estimated to be about 1500 km/s. The appearance of the CME in the coronagraph data indicates a southwesterly direction of the leading edge. Region 9957 (N10W04) continues to dominate the disk in terms of area and magnetic field strengths but is decaying and has been quiet. Region 9961 (S22E34) retains its complexity from yesterday and is growing slowly, but was also quiet. Two new sunspot groups were assigned today: Region 9964 (S15E08) and Region 9965 (S10E62)."

The source region for this event appears to have originated from the northwest limb, again, based on EIT/LASCO imagery.  Region 9973 (S16E34) produced several minor C-class flares and retains a moderately complex beta-gamma magnetic structure to the spot group.

This event also caused an enhancement in energetic protons (see section IIA below).  Other activity included a multi-peak C-class event with maximum flux of C3.5 at 07/0401 UTC.  H-alpha imagery from the IPS Culgoora observatory revealed an active prominence on the southwest limb as well as plage brightening in Region 19 (S19W32) in association with this event.

LASCO imagery revealed no evident CME activity following the first event, and was unavailable for the second event, however neither event was accompanied by any significant CME-related radio emissions.  A 19-degree filament disappearance occurred near N28W51 at about 11/0700, close to the western end of a long filament channel that extends to the northeast limb.  No CME was evident in available LASCO imagery following this event.  Regions 61 (N07W28), 66 (N13E42), and newly numbered 69 (S08E77) were all sources of lesser C-class activity.  Region 61 appears to be undergoing an accelerated decay in size and complexity.  New Region 69 appears large and complex in white light, but its limb proximity prevents a detailed magnetic analysis.  Three other regions were also numbered:  70 (N05W05), 71 (N11E68), and 72 (N18W23).

Region 66 (N14E16) showed a minor increase in spots and area with some polarity mixing evident within its intermediate spots. Minor growth was also observed in Region 63 (N18W14) and Region 72 (S18W48). Region 58 (S07W89) produced a few subflares as it crossed the west limb. Two slow coronal mass ejections (estimated plane of sky velocity about 205 km/sec) occurred during the period. The source for the CMEs appeared to be beyond the southeast limb.

After further review of a more comprehensive database set, it appears that the M4 flare that occurred yesterday (no region has been assigned to flare) at 28/1859 UTC could have originated from several different source regions.  The most probable source region appears to be from the northeast limb which corresponds to Region 95 (N07E76), which rotated onto the visible disk and became a newly numbered region today.  Region 95 did produce the largest flare today, an impulsive M3/Sf flare occurring at 29/1252 UTC with an associated 720 pfu Tenflare.  Proximity to limb hinders any meaningful analysis of this region at this time as the most recent white-light images indicate the trailing cluster of spots have yet fully rotated into view. Three other optically uncorrelated low level M-class flares occurred today along with multiple C-class flares.  Region 87 (S08W20) showed steady decay over the period although it retains a weak delta magnetic structure in the southeast portion of the spot complex. Despite the region's magnetic structure it only managed to produce minor activity today.  The remaining active regions were of little note.  Regions 93 (S16E13) and 94 (S17E67) were also assigned today."

A shock in the solar wind was observed by the NASA ACE spacecraft at 07/1609 UTC and was followed by a 7 nT sudden impulse on the Boulder magnetometer at 07/1638 UTC. This shock is believed to be related to the eruptive filament and CME which occurred on 05 September. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux crossed the 10 pfu event threshold at 07/0440 UTC after a slow rise over the previous 28 hours. Peak event flux so far was 208 pfu at 07/1650 UTC. Retrospect analysis suggests that these particles are most likely associated with the eruptive filament mentioned above rather than a west limb event as suggested yesterday."

Analysis of recent data indicating a restructuring of the magnetic field and the materialization of satellite spots warranted the separation of the two main clusters of spots in Region 105 (now centered at S07W18). Newly numbered Region 114 (S12W02) is the trailing portion of spots previously included in Region 105.  Region 114 produced the largest flare of the period, a C4.5/Sf at 14/1831 UTC, and at the time of this writing, data shows only a very weak delta class spot remaining indicating continued decay of this region.  Region 105 produced several C-class events today, the largest was a C4.1/Sf flare occurring at 14/1453 UTC, this region has also shown decay during the period.  H-alpha imagery suggests both these regions were simultaneously responsible for the intermittent and slightly elevated x-ray flux seen during the latter part of the day.  The remaining numbered regions were quiet.  New Region 115 (S03E45) was also assigned today."

Both were M1/Sf flares, at 20/0512Z and 0928Z, and both were accompanied by minor centimetric bursts. Limb proximity makes it too difficult to accurately assess Region 126's complexity, but initial measurements indicate a D type group with 200 millionths of white light areal coverage. Region 119 (S14W24) continues to grow and the delta configuration is now more pronounced. Despite this region's moderate complexity, flare output has been nothing more than occasional minor C-class flares. Early in the period, a large CME was observed, originating along a filament channel near S30E12. The ejecta does not appear earthward directed. New Regions 127 (S14E19) and 128 (N11E63) were numbered today. Region 127 is in close proximity to Region 122 (S18E21), but the consensus is that these are separate regions."

Region 134 (N11E38) showed a marked increase in flare productivity during the past 24 hours, including two M-class events. The first was an M1/Sf at 1312 UTC and the second was an M1/Sf at 1942 UTC. Coronagraph data show a relatively narrow CME off the northeast limb in association with the first M-class event. Insufficient data were available at forecast issue time to make any CME association with the second M-class event. Analysis of the Region 134 shows the development of a small delta configuration along an east-west inversion line, and observations indicate the build up of magnetic shear in this part of the region. The only other flare-producing region on the disk was Region 132 (N19W65), which managed to produce a couple C-class subflares, but appeared to be in a state of decline. New Region 135 (S26E06) emerged on the disk today as a simple D-type sunspot group."

This event was accompanied by a large CME evident in SOHO/LASCO imagery, with an estimated plane-of-sky velocity of about 850 km/s.  Region 159 also produced a C4/Sf event at 14/0945 UTC.  A Type-II radio sweep of estimated velocity 743 km/s was observed at 14/1429 UTC, in association with a small impulsive C1 flare, and followed shortly thereafter by a very long-lived enhancement in x-ray flux that began at about 14/1520 UTC, and remained in progress at the end of the period.  Available H-alpha imagery revealed no apparent source for this activity, and SOHO EIT and LASCO data were mostly unavailable for the period.  The lack of subsequent particle enhancement from this potential CME event seems to suggest an east-limb source for this activity.  New Region 160 (S20E54) was numbered today."

A filament from central meridian through the southern hemisphere erupted shortly before this flare and is believed to have been the trigger for the event.  SOHO/LASCO imagery depicts an associated CME to the event which does not appear to be earth directed.  No significant changes were noted today in the spot group or the magnetic complexity to this region.  Region 140 (S08W52) produced a C1/Sf flare at 15/1326 UTC.

Additional frequent C-class subflares were produced by this region throughout the day. New Region 173 (S17W69) emerged on the disk today and new Region 172 (S17E44) was assigned. An erupting prominence was observed near the northeast limb beginning around 2200 UTC and was associated with a narrow CME in LASCO as well as a type II sweep with shock velocity of 1015 km/s. The event was promptly followed by a back-sided full halo CME which was first observed in LASCO at 2326 UTC."

Region 213 (N14E50) produced an impulsive M2/2n event, with associated tenflare and Type II/IV radio sweeps, at 04/2249 UTC.  The region appears to be a relatively small sunspot group with minor magnetic complexity, near the somewhat larger Region 212 (N12E35) which remained quiescent during the period. Single C- and B-class x-ray enhancements were also observed without optical correlation later in the period, but otherwise the x-ray emissions from the sun have remained relatively flat.  Two new regions were numbered today:  214 (N12W27) and 215 (S18E74).  The latter appears to be a return of old Region 191 (S18, L=203) but limb proximity prevents detailed analysis."
