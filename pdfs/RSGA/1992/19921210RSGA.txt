TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. NEARLY ALL OF THE SMALL
FLARES OBSERVED ORIGINATED IN REGION 7362 (S04E05). THIS REGION
GREW SUBSTANTIALLY IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA WHILE DEVELOPING
A MODEST DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. AN AS YET UNNUMBERED
REGION NEAR S11E80 HAD BOTH OF THE DAY'S REMAINING SUBFLARES.

LOW TO MODERATE. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN REGION 7362 MAY RESULT
IN AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT. NEARBY REGIONS 7360 (S17E18) AND
7363 (S07E46) BEAR WATCHING.
