JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 232 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 19 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7260 (N17W24)
REMAINED THE PREMIER REGION IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA, BUT
COULD MUSTER JUST A FEW C-CLASS SUBFLARES DURING THE INTERVAL.
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OCCURRED IN THE AREA OF THE TRAILER SPOTS,
PUSHING THE WHITE LIGHT AREA OF THE WHOLE GROUP TO A SIZEABLE
1300 MILLIONTHS. THE MIXTURE OF MAGNETIC POLARITIES AT POINTS
AROUND THE REGION IS APPARENT AGAIN TODAY. ELSEWHERE, NEW REGION
7265 (S19E66) CAME FULLY INTO VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. HOWEVER, THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN M-CLASS FLARE
FROM REGION 7260 MAY INCREASE IF CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OCCURS
THERE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MILDLY UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.

BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPARATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20
        MINOR STORM                  05/05/01
        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           03/01/01
    B. HIGH LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       40/25/20
        MINOR STORM                  10/10/05
        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
DETAILS AND FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE PROBABILISTIC
FORECASTS.
