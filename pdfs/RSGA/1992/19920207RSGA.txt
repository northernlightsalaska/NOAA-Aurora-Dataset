JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 038 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DURING THE LAST 24
HOURS.  REGION 7039 (S14W54) PRODUCED AN M3/2B FLARE THAT
MAXED AT 1159Z.  THIS LONG DURATION EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
STRONG TYPE IV RADIO EMISSION AND A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP.
REGION 7039 PRODUCED OTHER SUBFAINT FLARES, AND GREW IN
WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA SINCE YESTERDAY.  FOUR NEW REGIONS
WERE NUMBERED TODAY.  THEY WERE 7051 (N21E07), 7052 (S21E67),
7053 (S11E74), AND 7054 (N13E75).  STRONG SURGING WAS
REPORTED ON BOTH LIMBS.  ON THE WEST LIMB THE DEPARTURE
OF REGION 7033 NEAR S13 PRODUCED SURGING TO 0.09 SOLAR RADII,
AND SURGING ON THE EAST LIMB OCCURRED NEAR N15 AND S17.
FLARE LOOPS WERE ALSO REPORTED NEAR S14E90 BEGINNING AT
1310Z AND ENDING AFTER 1403Z.  A BUSHY, 14-DEGREE-LONG
FILAMENT IN THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT DISAPPEARED BETWEEN
0733-1250Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  REGIONS 7039 AND 7042 (S12W27) ARE MAGNETICALLY
COMPLEX AND ARE CAPABLE OF CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  A SOLAR PROTON ENHANCEMENT THAT BEGAN
MID-DAY ON THE 6TH CROSSED EVENT THRESHOLD 07/O645Z.  THE
EVENT MAXIMUM WAS 78 PFU AT 1115 AND DECREASED SLOWLY
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  A GEOMAGNETIC STORM IS
EXPECTED TO COMMENCE ON 08 FEBRUARY IN RESPONSE THE HIGH
LEVELS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED ON 6 FEBRUARY.  THE
PEAK OF THE DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED LATE ON THE 8TH OR EARLY
ON THE 9TH, SUBSIDING ON THE 10TH.  THE PROTON EVENT IS
EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE SOLAR WIND
SHOCK.  IF NO NEW INJECTIONS OCCUR, THE PRESENT PROTON
EVENT SHOULD END BY FEBRUARY 10TH.
