JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 035 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7030 (N08W69)
GENERATED THE ONLY M-CLASS FLARE, THAT AN IMPULSIVE M1/0N AT
0403Z. THIS REGION GREW IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA. THE OTHER
SIGNIFICANT REGIONS VISIBLE, 7031 (S05W78) AND 7042 (S12E10),
WERE UNPRODUCTIVE AND SLOWLY DECAYING. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED, 7046 (S10W43) AND 7047 (S22E58).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE THE NEXT THREE DAYS. ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES MAY
OCCUR IN REGIONS 7042, 7031, AND 7030.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD VARIED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
THE MOST DISTURBED TIMES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL SUBSTORMS
WHICH OCCURRED IN NIGHTTIME SECTORS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 15
NANOTESLA WAS RECORDED AT BOULDER AT 1907Z, AND ACTIVE
CONDITIONS ARE NOW IN EFFECT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD. SOME DEGREE OF SUBSTORM ACTIVITY IS LIKELY IN
NIGHTTIME SECTORS.
