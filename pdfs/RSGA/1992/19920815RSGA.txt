THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT
MID-LATITUDES, AND MINOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES ON 18
AUGUST DUE TO A RECURRING CORONAL HOLE.
