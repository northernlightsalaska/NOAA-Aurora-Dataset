JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 115 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7138 (N10W03)
PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS FLARES TODAY: AN M1/1B AT 1253Z AND AN
M1/1B AT 1920Z. THE GROUP SHOWS A DELTA CONFIGURATION WHICH
APPEARS TO BE SHEARING AND THUS PROVIDING THE IMPETUS FOR
THE M-FLARES AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FREQUENT SMALL FLARES.
THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT THE REGION IS BEGINNING TO
DECAY. REGION 7135 (S17W26) HAS BEEN QUIET AND IS SLOWLY
DECAYING: THE MAGNETIC FIELDS WERE MORE RELAXED TODAY AND
THE DELTA CONFIGURATION IS GONE. REGION 7143 (S06E55) HAS
SHOWN MODEST GROWTH AND HAS A WEAK SIMPLE DELTA: THE GROUP
PRODUCED OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES. THREE LARGE FILAMENTS
DISAPPEARED FROM THE SOLAR DISK: A 22 DEGREE FILAMENT AT
N30W20, A 25 DEGREE FILAMENT AT N33W36, AND A 23 DEGREE
FILAMENT AT S41E13.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE CHANGES OF THE LAST 24 HOURS SUGGEST THAT
REGIONS 7138 AND 7143 ARE NOW THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR SOME
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 7135 REMAINS RESPECT-
ABLE AND COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO M-LEVEL ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A BRIEF ACTIVE PERIOD WAS OBSERVED
AT MID-LATITUDES FROM 23/2100-2400UT AND AT HIGH LATITUDES
FROM 23/2100-24/0600UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
TODAY'S FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCES (DSF'S) ARE NOT LIKELY TO
INCREASE ACTIVITY SINCE NO LONG DURATION X-RAY EVENT OR TYPE
II/IV RADIO SWEEP OCCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DSF'S.
