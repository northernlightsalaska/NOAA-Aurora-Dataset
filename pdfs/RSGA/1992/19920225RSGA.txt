JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 056 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 25 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7070 (N07E14)
PRODUCED THE ONLY M-CLASS FLARE OF THE PERIOD, AN M4/2B
PARALLEL RIBBON EVENT AT 24/2335Z. RADIO BURSTS INCLUDED A
TENFLARE OF 450 SFU AS WELL AS A TYPE IV SWEEP THAT WAS
REPORTED TO LAST AT LEAST 4 HOURS. THE REGION IS NOW MEASURED
TO BE 600 MILLIONTHS IN WHITE LIGHT AREA, AND HAVE A MODERATE
DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. ELSEWHERE, VERY FEW FLARES
WERE REPORTED FROM THE OTHER 12 SPOTTED REGIONS. ONE NEW
REGION, 7079 (S14W55), WAS BORN ON THE DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7070 IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR ADDITIONAL M-
CLASS FLARES, AND REGION 7067 (N04W11), THE LARGEST REGION
NOW VISIBLE, MAY OFFER AN M-CLASS EVENT TOO.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT PREDOMINANTLY MINOR TO
MAJOR STORM LEVELS THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
A LARGE FILAMENT ON FEBRUARY 22ND IS THE LIKELY CAUSE OF
THE ACTIVITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
24 HOURS. THIS PERIOD OF RELATIVE CALM SHOULD BE BRIEF AS
EFFECTS FROM THE M4/2B FLARE OF 24/2335Z ARE DUE THE LAST 2
DAYS OF THE INTERVAL WHEN MINOR STORM LEVELS SHOULD PREVAIL.
