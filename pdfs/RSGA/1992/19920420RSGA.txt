JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 111 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7135 (S16E26)
PRODUCED AN M1/SN FLARE AT 0528Z. THIS GROUP CONTINUED TO DOM-
INATE THE DISK IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY AND PRODUCED NUMEROUS
C-CLASS EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS IN-
DICATED SLIGHT DECAY AND FRAGMENTATION INCLUDING LOSS OF THE
DELTA CONFIGURATION. NONETHELESS THE GROUP REMAINS BRIGHT IN
H-ALPHA PLAGE. THE OTHER SUNSPOT GROUPS WERE RELATIVELY QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7135 SHOWS A GOOD POSSIBILITY OF PRO-
DUCING AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
REGIONS 7132 (S26W11), 7137 (S19E44), AND 7138 (N09E50) SHOW
SOME COMPLEXITY AND MAY ALSO PRODUCE SOME C-CLASS FLARE LEVEL
ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. THE
INCREASE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE, OR BY A LONG DURATION C6/DSF WHICH OCCURRED
ON THE 18TH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED WITH A POSSIBILITY FOR
BRIEF ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
