JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 185 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 JUL 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. CLOUDS PREVENTED
OBSERVATIONS OF THE SITE OF AN M2 X-RAY FLARE AT 1000Z. A BURST
OF 190 SFU AT 10 CM WAS AMONG THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVENT.
REGIONS 7216 (N15E18) AND 7218 (N08W46) ARE THE ONLY SPOTTED
REGIONS NOW VISIBLE. BOTH HAVE DECAYED DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. HOWEVER, ANOTHER ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE MAY OCCUR DURING
THE FORECAST PERIOD FROM REGION 7216 OR, LESS LIKELY, FROM
REGION 7218. ALSO, X-RAY DATA INDICATE THE ARRIVAL OF A BRIGHT
REGION AT EAST LIMB, NEAR THE EQUATOR, DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT 12-24 HOURS. A DISTURBANCE RELATED TO THE DISAPPEARANCE
OF A FEW FILAMENTS FROM CENTER DISK ON 30 JUNE-01 JULY SHOULD
CAUSE ACTIVE CONDITIONS AT ALL LATITUDES ON O5 JULY. MOSTLY
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO CLOSE THE INTERVAL.
