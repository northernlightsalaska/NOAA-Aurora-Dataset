JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 341 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 DEC 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TWO CLASS C2 FLARES
OCCURRED - ONE AT 06/0032Z AND THE OTHER REACHED MAXIMUM NEAR
1920Z. THE LATTER EVENT BEGAN NEAR 1700Z AND WAS OF VERY LONG
DURATION. NO UNAMBIGUOUS OPTICAL CORRELATION WAS RECEIVED FOR
THE LONG DURATION EVENT. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF THE X-RAY
ENHANCEMENT, OBSERVATORIES DID REPORT A WEAK LOOP PROMINENCE
SYSTEM BECOMING VISIBLE AT NE09. ONLY A WEAK SPOTLESS REGION
WAS VISIBLE AT THAT LOCATION LAST ROTATION. NEW REGION 7361
(S15W73) EMERGED AND GREW AT A MODERATE PACE. PLAGE IN THIS
REGION WAS ALSO ENHANCED DURING THE LDE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A LOW LEVEL. IN SPITE OF THE LDE MENTIONED ABOVE, THERE
ARE NO SIGNIFICANT REGIONS DUE TO RETURN. THE CURRENT DISK
REGIONS DO NOT APPEAR CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ENERGETIC FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED ON 07 DEC BECOMING GENERALLY ACTIVE ON
08-09 DEC. DURING THIS PERIOD, SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS
MAY EXPERIENCE INTERVALS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS. THE
SOURCE OF THIS FORECAST DISTURBANCE IS A TRANSEQUATORIAL
LOBE OF THE SOUTHERN POLAR CORONAL HOLE WHICH APPEARS TO
HAVE EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE LAST ROTATION.
