JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 287 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TWO LONG DURATION FLARES
OCCURRED TODAY: A C5 WITH MAXIMUM AT 1614Z AND A C7 WITH MAXIMUM
AT 2021Z. THE C5 FLARE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERATE TYPE II AND
TYPE IV RADIO SWEEPS. NEITHER FLARE WAS WELL CORRELATED WITH
OPTICAL FLARE REPORTS SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE BEHIND EAST LIMB
SOURCE. THIS POSSIBILITY IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVATIONS
OF LOOPS AND SURGE ACTIVITY REPORTED FROM N18E90. REGION 7306
(S08W59) CONTINUED TO DECAY TODAY AND WAS QUIET. THREE NEW
REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY: 7309 (S16W25), 7310 (N09E53) AND
7311 (S17E60).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. AN INCREASE IN BACKGROUND LEVELS IS EXPECTED, HOWEVER, AS
THE SUSPECTED REGION BEHIND THE EAST LIMB ROTATES INTO VIEW.
THIS REGION TOGETHER WITH REGION 7306 PRESENT A SLIGHT CHANCE
FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD UNTIL ABOUT 13/1500Z. A SMALL
INCREASE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS BEGAN AT THAT TIME
AND CONTINUES IN PROGRESS AT FORECAST ISSUE TIME. THE SOURCE
OF THE INCREASE IS UNCERTAIN BUT THE LONG DURATION C8
FLARE WITH A TYPE II SWEEP THAT OCCURRED EARLY ON 11 OCTOBER
LOOKS TO BE A GOOD POSSIBILITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS AND
SHOULD DECLINE TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
FIRST DAY OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BECOME MOSTLY ACTIVE ON THE SECOND DAY IN RESPONSE
TO A CORONAL HOLE WHICH WILL BE FAVORABLY POSITIONED AT THAT
TIME. ACTIVITY LEVELS SHOULD GRADUALLY DECLINE BY THE THIRD
DAY.
