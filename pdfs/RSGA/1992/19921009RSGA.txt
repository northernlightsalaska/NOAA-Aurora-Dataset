JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 283 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. FLARE ACTIVITY WAS
MINIMAL IN THE PAST 24 HOURS, WITH WHAT FEW THERE WERE COMING
PRIMARILY FROM REGIONS 7303 (S13W48) AND 7306 (S08W03).
SIMPLIFICATION HAS OCCURRED IN EACH REGION. ONE NEW REGION WAS
ASSIGNED, 7307 (S17E40).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE MAY COME FROM EITHER
REGION 7306 OR 7303.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET UNTIL ABOUT 0900Z.
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE THEN SEEN AT ALL
LATITUDES AND PERSIST AT THIS WRITING. A WELL-DEFINED SOURCE
OF THIS DISTURBANCE IS NOT APPARENT. A SOUTHWARD IMF IS LIKELY
TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS CURRENT SCENARIO.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED THE NEXT 3 DAYS. THE
CURRENT PERTURBATION SHOULD WANE OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS.
