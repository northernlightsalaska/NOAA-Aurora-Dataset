JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 037 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. TWO MAJOR FLARES OCCURRED
TODAY: THE FIRST WAS AN M7/SN AT 0329Z FROM REGION 7030
(N07W93), AND THE SECOND WAS AN M6/1N AT 1859Z FROM REGION
7039 (S14W41).BOTH EVENTS WERE IMPULSIVE. SOMEWHAT MORE
IMPRESSIVE WAS A LONG DURATION M4/2B FLARE FROM REGION 7042
(S11W16) WHICH LASTED ABOUT 150 MINUTES. THE M4 FLARE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY MODERATELY STRONG RADIO BURSTS AND A MODERATE
TYPE IV SWEEP. ADDITIONAL M-FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE DAY:
AN M2/1B AT 1356Z FROM 7048 (S04E24) AND AN M4 AT 2103UT.
THE SOURCE FOR THE LATTER APPEARS TO BE 7030 SINCE STRONG
SURGING WAS SEEN ON WEST LIMB AT 7030'S LATITUDE DURING THE
EVENT. REGION 7042 IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE LOOKING REGION ON
THE DISK, BUT SHOWED DECAY AND FRAGMENTATION DURING THE PAST
24 HOURS. REGION 7039 SHOWS BOTH GROWTH AND DECAY IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE GROUP AND APPEARS TO BE COMBINING
WITH REGION 7035 (S18W52). NOTE: CORRECTION TO YESTERDAY'S
REPORT - THE M3 AT 2032Z WAS FROM THE SOUTHWEST LIMB
(S07W89), NOT THE SOUTHEAST (S07E89) AS WAS STATED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH A CHANCE FOR ISOLATED MAJOR FLARES OVER THE NEXT
THREE DAYS. THE DOMINANT REGIONS ARE 7030, 7039, 7042. THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF 7030 WILL DECLINE AS IT ROTATES FARTHER
AROUND WEST LIMB. REGIONS 7035 (S18W52), 7048 (S04E24) AND
NEW REGION 7050 (N13E67 - D-TYPE) ARE ALSO RESPECTABLE AND
COULD CONTRIBUTE TO MODERATE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THROUGH TOMORROW AND PART-
WAY THROUGH THE SECOND DAY. AN INCREASE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
AT MID-LATITUDES AND MAJOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES IS
EXPECTED SOMETIME ON THE SECOND DAY. THE DISTURBANCE IS
EXPECTED TO LAST THROUGH MOST OF THE THIRD DAY. THIS DISTUR-
BANCE IS EXPECTED AS A RESPONSE TO TODAY'S LONG DURATION M4
FLARE FROM REGION 7042.
