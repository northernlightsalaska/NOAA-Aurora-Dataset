JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 113 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7139 (S17E26),
A BXO GROUP OF AREA 30 MILLTIONTHS PRODUCED AN M1/2B FLARE AT
0120Z. THE GROUP WAS NOT REMARKABLE IN ANY OTHER RESPECT AND
SHOWED PHOTOSPHERIC AND CHROMOSPHERIC SIMPLICITY AND STABILITY.
REGION 7135 (S16W00) CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE
DISK AND SHOWED SOME RESTRUCTURING, INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF
A SMALL DELTA NEAR THE REGION'S CENTER. NONETHELESS THE GROUP
COULD ONLY MUSTER A COUPLE OF SUBFLARES DURING THE DAY. REGIONS
7137 (S19E18) AND 7138 (N10E23) ALSO SHOWED MINOR GROWTH AND
PRODUCED A COUPLE OF SUBFLARES. REGION 7138 APPEARS TO ALSO
HAVE A DELTA CONFIGURATION. NOTE ALSO THAT TODAY'S 10.7 CM
FLUX DROPPED DESPITE GROWTH AND EMERGENCE OF NEW REGIONS ON
THE DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7135 CONTINUES TO SHOW GOOD CHAR-
ACTERISTICS OF PRODUCING AN ISOLATED M-FLARE. REGIONS
7137 AND 7138 ALSO SHOW SOME FLARE POTENTIAL AND MIGHT
ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO MODERATE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. SOME
INTERMITTENT PERIODS OF ACTIVE LEVELS OCCURRED AT HIGH
LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
