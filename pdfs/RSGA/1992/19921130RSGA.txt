JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 335 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7353 (S03E08),
A SMALL AND UNIMPRESSIVE SPOT GROUP, PRODUCED AN IMPULSIVE M2/1N
FLARE WITH ASSOCIATED TYPE II AT 1929Z. THE REGION HAD DONE
NOTHING TO INDICATE THIS LEVEL OF ACTIVITY PRIOR TO THE FLARE.
IN FACT, THE SITE SHOWING THE MOST RESTRUCTURING AND GROWTH
DURING THE INTERVAL WAS REGION 7352 (N20W27). IT INCREASED ITS
WHITE LIGHT AREA BY 50 PERCENT AND NOW MAY CARRY A WEAK DELTA IN
ITS INTERMEDIATE SPOTS. THIS GROUP HAD OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES
IN CONCERT WITH ITS NEARBY NEIGHBOR, REGION 7348 (N12W29). ONE
NEW REGION, 7354 (S23W51), WAS BORN ON THE DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. HOWEVER, WATCH REGIONS 7353, 7352, AND 7348 FOR AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
