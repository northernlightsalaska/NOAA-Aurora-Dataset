SDF NUMBER 046 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 7056 (S12W11)
PRODUCED AN M7/2B FLARE AT 14/2310Z. A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM
AND MINOR DISCRETE RADIO EMISSIONS ACCOMPANIED THE FLARE. THE
REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/1B FLARE AT 15/0518, AND AN M1/1N
FLARE AT 15/0840Z. THESE FLARES WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH MINOR
RADIO EMISSIONS. MINOR GROWTH WAS OBSERVED IN THE REGION DURING
THE PAST DAY. A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM AND SURGING WERE NOTED
BEHIND THE SOUTHEAST LIMB NEAR S14, POSSIBLY INDICATING THE
RETURN OF OLD REGION 7026 WHICH PRODUCED MODERATE LEVELS OF
ACTIVITY LAST TRANSIT. NEW REGIONS 7062 (S08W23) AND 7063
(S14E54) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 7056 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES AND ALSO PROVIDES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
X-CLASS FLARE. REGION 7050 (N12W50) POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR
M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST DAY. THE
FIELD IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE BALANCE OF THE PERIOD IN RESPONSE TO THE M7/2B FLARE
MENTIONED ABOVE.
