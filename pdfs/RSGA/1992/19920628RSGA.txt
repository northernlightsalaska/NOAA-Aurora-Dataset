JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 180 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 JUN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH DUE TO AN X1 FLARE AT
0445UT.  THIS EVENT APPEARS TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM REGION
7205 (N11 L313), NOW TWO DAYS BEHIND WEST LIMB.  LOOPS WERE
OBSERVED OVER THE WEST LIMB NEAR N11 AFTER THIS XRAY EVENT.
M1 FLARES WITHOUT OPTICAL COUNTERPARTS WERE OBSERVED AT
0313UT AND 1353UT.  FOUR NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED, REGIONS
7214 (S15W15), 7215 (S23E61), AND 7217 (N06E41) ARE SMALL
SIMPLE GROUPS, WHILE REGION 7216 (N13E75) IS A LARGE H TYPE
SPOT.  REGION 7216 MAY STILL HAVE TRAILERS BEHIND THE EAST
LIMB.  IT IS THE BRIGHTEST REGION ON THE DISK.  SEVERAL SMALL
FILAMENTS MAKING UP THE NORTH-SOUTH BOUNDARY OF THE LARGE
SCALE MAGNETIC FIELD JUST WEST OF CM HAVE DISAPPEARED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  M CLASS FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM REGION 7216
AND CAN STILL BE OBSERVED FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS FROM DEPARTED
REGION 7205 IF IT PRODUCES ADDITIONAL MAJOR FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO STORM LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THE PROTON EVENT REMAINS IN PROGRESS.
FLUXES WERE DECLINING UNTIL 1200UT WHEN LEVELS SHOWED A
SMALL INCREASE, PROBABLY DUE TO THE X1 FLARE.  CURRENTLY,
THE P10 FLUX IS ONCE AGAIN NEAR EVENT THRESHOLDS (10PFU).
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.  THE PROTON EVENT SHOULD
END IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.
