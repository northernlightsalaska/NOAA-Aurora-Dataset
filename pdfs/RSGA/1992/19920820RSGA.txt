JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 233 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7260 (N16W38)
GREW TO A WHITE LIGHT AREA OF OVER 1400 MILLIONTHS AND PRODUCED
ITS FIRST M-CLASS FLARES. THE ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF AN M2/1B AT
0921Z; AN M4/1B AT 1437Z; A MULTIPLE MAXIMA, LONG-LIVED M1/1B
TENFLARE (240 SFU AT 2695 MHZ) WITH X-RAY MAXIMA AT 1729Z AND
1802Z; AND LASTLY AN M3/1B AT 2046Z. THE FLARES HAVE OCCURRED IN
THE TRAILER PORTION OF THIS ELONGATED GROUP WHERE SIGNIFICANT
GROWTH HAS BEEN NOTED RECENTLY. THE REGION SEEMS TO RETAIN ITS
POTENCY AND IS BY FAR THE DOMINANT FEATURE ON AN OTHERWISE
DULL DISK. TODAY'S MARKED INCREASE IN THE 10.7 CM RADIO FLUX
FURTHER ATTESTS TO THE DYNAMIC CHANGES IN REGION 7260.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AT MODERATE LEVELS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF REGION 7260.
STILL HIGHER LEVELS OF ACTIVITY ARE WITHIN ITS GRASP IF
ADDITIONAL DYNAMIC GROWTH OCCURS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD VARIED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS AT MID LATITUDES, AND QUIET TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE STORM CONDITIONS OCCURRED DURING
LOCAL NIGHTTIME HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. EPISODES
OF ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS MAY OCCUR DURING LOCAL
NIGHTTIME HOURS.

BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPARATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20
        MINOR STORM                  05/05/01
        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           03/01/01
    B. HIGH LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       40/25/20
        MINOR STORM                  10/10/05
        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
DETAILS AND FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE PROBABILISTIC
FORECASTS.
