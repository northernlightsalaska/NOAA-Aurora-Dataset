TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7248 (S13W63)
ISSUED AN M1/1N FLARE AT 12/0234Z. AN OPTICALLY UNASSOCIATED
M1 FLARE ALSO OCCURRED AT 11/2228Z. REGION 7248 HAS DECREASED
IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 7260
(N16E63) HAS A NORTH-SOUTH INVERSION LINE AND IS THE LARGEST

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 7248 AND 7260 BOTH HAVE MODERATE FLARE
POTENTIAL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM 0600 TO 1500Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED. THE FIELD SHOULD BE QUIET AT MID-
LATITUDES DURING THE FINAL TWO DAYS OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPERATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20
        MINOR STORM                  05/05/01

        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
