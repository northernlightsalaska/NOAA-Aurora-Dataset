JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 307 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 7321, NOW MORE
THAN A DAY BEYOND WEST LIMB AT S25, GENERATED AN X9 TENFLARE
(5000 SFU AT 2695 MHZ) AT 0308Z. THE EVENT ALSO INCLUDED TYPES
II AND IV SWEEP AND BRIGHT LOOPS VISIBLE FOR MANY HOURS
AFTER THE X-RAY MAXIMUM. ELSEWHERE, LITTLE ACTIVITY OF NOTE
OCCURRED ON THE VISIBLE DISK, WHERE SEVEN UNIMPRESSIVE REGIONS
REMAIN.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGIONS 7323 (S15W54) AND 7330 (S08E58) OFFER THE BEST
CHANCE OF FLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 7321 MAY PROVIDE YET ANOTHER
PARTING SHOT FROM THE SOUTHWEST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD VARIED FROM QUIET TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.
A SUDDEN IMPULSE, MEASURING 60 NANOTESLA AT BOULDER, OCCURRED
AT 01/2146Z. THIS SHOCK, LIKELY SPAWNED BY THE X1/2B FLARE OF
30 OCT, CAUSED BRIEF EPISODES OF MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS, BUT,
LACKING A SOUTHWARD IMF TO FOLLOW, A FULL BLOWN MAGNETIC STORM
DID NOT SUBSEQUENTLY OCCUR. TODAY'S X9 FLARE CAUSED PROTON
FLUXES TO RISE RAPIDLY, WITH A HARDER SPECTRUM THAN THE EVENT
WHICH BEGAN LAST FRIDAY. THE GREATER THAN 100 MEV FLUXES
PASSED THE 100 PFU THRESHOLD AT 0520Z, REACHED A MAX OF 120 PFU
AT 0545Z, AND DROPPED BELOW EVENT LEVEL AT 0600Z. THE GREATER
THAN 10 MEV FLUX ACHIEVED A SECONDARY MAXIMUM IN THE ONGOING
EVENT, REACHING 790 PFU AT 0550Z. THE POLAR CAP ABSORPTION IS
STILL IN PROGRESS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. A
SIGNIFICANT GEOMAGNETIC RESPONSE TO TODAY'S X9 FLARE IS NOT
ANTICIPATED. THE ENHANCED PROTON FLUXES SHOULD SLOWLY DECAY
TO NOMINAL LEVELS OVER THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS.
