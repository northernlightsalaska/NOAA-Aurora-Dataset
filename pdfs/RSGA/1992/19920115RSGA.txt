SDF NUMBER 015 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 JAN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  REGION 7012 (S09E73)
PRODUCED AN M2 FLARE AT 1902UT.  REGION 7012 CONTAINS A SMALL
SPOT GROUP WITH EXTENDED PLAGE AND MAY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF
THE M FLARE YESTERDAY.  REGION 7008 (S10E23) MAY BE GROWING BUT
HAS PRODUCED ONLY SMALL FLARES.  THE FILAMENT NEAR N15W30 AND
THE ONE NEAR S18W35 DISAPPEARED AFTER 14/1635UT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  M CLASS FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS
7008 AND 7012.  FORMER ACTIVE REGIONS 6985 (S16 L101) AND 6988
(S14 L077) ARE DUE BACK LATE IN THE PERIOD AND MAY RAISE THE
CHANCE FOR MAJOR FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED.  THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE FIELD
WILL BECOME MORE ACTIVE LATE IN THE PERIOD AS A RESULT OF
EFFECTS FROM THE DSF'S REPORTED IN IA.
