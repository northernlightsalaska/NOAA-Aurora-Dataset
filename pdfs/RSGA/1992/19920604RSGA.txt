JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 156 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 JUN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7186 (N10E40)
PRODUCED THE SOLE C-CLASS FLARE OF THE DAY, A C7/1B WITH
ASSOCIATED TYPE II AT 0415Z. POST-FLARE LOOPS WERE SEEN NEAR
THE FLARE SITE FOR MANY HOURS AFTER THE FLARE MAXIMUM. THIS
REGION IS THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLEX SPOT GROUP NOW VISIBLE.
ELSEWHERE, THREE NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED. THEY ARE 7190
(S05E23), 7191 (N08E50), AND 7192 (N10E71).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AT THE LOW LEVEL. ANY INCREASE BEYOND THAT IS
DEPENDENT ON THE EVOLUTION OF REGION 7186.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT TIMES OVER THE NEXT
THREE DAYS. FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCES SINCE 31 MAY COULD TRIGGER
A MAGNETOSPHERIC RESPONSE IF THE OTHER NECESSARY INTERPLANETARY
CONDITIONS EVENTUATE.
