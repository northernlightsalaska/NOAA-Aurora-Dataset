JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 224 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7248 (S13W50)
PRODUCED A C7/1N FLARE AT 11/1348Z. A C6 FLARE OF UNKNOWN
ORIGIN OCCURRED AT 10/2104Z AS WELL. A NEW REGION WAS ASSIGNED,
REGION 7260 (N17E72) WHICH CAUSED 5 C-CLASS FLARES LAST
ROTATION. THIS REGION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO C-CLASS FLARES
DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7248 HAS STABILIZED. REGION 7260 IS TOO
CLOSE TO THE LIMB TO DETERMINE MUCH ABOUT IT YET. X-RAY IMAGERY
SUGGESTS IT HAS THE GREATEST M-CLASS POTENTIAL ON THE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. ACTIVE PERIODS ARE LIKELY
AT HIGH LATITUDES DUE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPERATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20
        MINOR STORM                  05/05/01
        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           03/01/01
    A. HIGH LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       40/25/20
        MINOR STORM                  10/10/05
        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
DETAILS AND FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE PROBABILISTIC
FORECASTS.
