JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 348 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 DEC 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. SEVERAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES
OCCURRED, MOST OF WHICH CAME FROM REGION 7366 (S12E31). THIS
REGION SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SIZE OR STRUCTURE. THE
SAME WAS TRUE FOR REGION 7362 (S06W36). BRIGHT SURGING WAS SEEN
ON THE EAST LIMB NEAR S23. THE SURGING EXTENDED TO .20 RADII AND
WAS PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 7345 WHICH
PRODUCED LOW TO MODERATE ACTIVITY DURING ITS LAST ROTATION. NO
NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW. REGIONS 7362 AND 7366 ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
C-CLASS SUBFLARES. BOTH REGIONS ALSO POSE A SLIGHT THREAT FOR
ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE HIGH
LATITUDE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO BE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
WITH BRIEF INTERVALS OF ACTIVE LEVELS POSSIBLE EARLY IN THE
PERIOD.
