JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 040 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. TWO M-CLASS FLARES
OCCURRED TODAY: AN M1/1F AT 0305Z FROM REGION 7035 (S16W84) AND
AN M1/2F AT 0545Z FROM REGION 7052 (S22E40). SURGING ACCOMPANIED
THE DEPARTURE OF REGIONS 7035 AND 7039 (S13W84) FROM THE DISK.
REGION 7042 (S12W57) CONTINUED TO DECLINE TODAY AND COULD ONLY
PRODUCE A COUPLE OF SUBFLARES. NEW GROWTH AND EMERGING FLUX WERE
NOTED TODAY IN REGIONS 7050 (N12E29), 7052 (S22E40), 7048
(S04W17) AND 7055 (S16W33). REGION 7050 IN PARTICULAR SHOWED
FREQUENT BRIGHT PLAGE FLUCTUATIONS, MATURING PENUMBRA AND
INCREASED MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. SEVERAL GROUPS ON THE DISK SHOW SOME CAPABILITY FOR
AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT. IN PARTICULAR, REGIONS 7050, 7042
AND 7052 SHOW THE MOST FLARE POTENTIAL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR
MOST OF THE PERIOD. AFTER A LULL IN YESTERDAY'S STORM, MINOR
TO MAJOR STORM LEVEL ACTIVITY RESUMED FROM 0000Z THROUGH
ABOUT 1500Z. THERE WAS A SLIGHT RELAXATION TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FROM 1500Z THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE FIRST DAY, AND
IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
