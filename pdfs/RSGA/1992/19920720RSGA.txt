SDF NUMBER 202 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 JUL 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7227 (N16W47)
PRODUCED THE ONLY FLARE ACTIVITY ON THE DISK TODAY. IT WAS A
LARGE SUB FAINT FLARE. THE X-RAY BACKGROUND WAS ELEVATED TO
ABOVE C2 LEVELS FOR MUCH OF THE DAY BECAUSE OF IMPULSIVE
PROMINENCE ACTIVITY ON THE SOUTHWEST LIMB. REGION 7229 (N23W43)
WAS THE BEST LOOKING REGION BUT SHOWED VERY LITTLE ACTIVITY.
THIS REGION SHOWED STRONG PENUMBRAL GROWTH EARLIER TODAY
BUT APPEARS TO HAVE STABILIZED IN THE PAST TWELVE HOURS.
REGIONS 7234 (S17W37), 7235 (S04W29) AND 7236 (N18E24) WERE
ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7229 STILL HAS THE BEST POTENTIAL FOR
C CLASS FLARES AND A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M CLASS FLARE.

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.

EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS THEN
