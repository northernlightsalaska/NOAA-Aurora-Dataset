JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 094 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY SMALL FLARES FROM
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REGIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED SINCE
YESTERDAY. REGIONS 7116 (S08W85) AND 7117 (N07W77) ARE QUIETLY
APPROACHING THE WEST LIMB. REGION 7123 (S06E55) IS NOW FULLY IN
VIEW. THIS REGION HAS A SIMPLE BIPOLAR CONFIGURATION AND IS OF
MODERATE SIZE. REGION 7124 (N14W36) IS EMERGING RAPIDLY. SUNSPOT
AREA HAS INCREASED FROM 10 MILLIONTHS TO WELL OVER 100
MILLIONTHS WITHIN THE PAST DAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED IN REGIONS 7123 AND 7124.
THESE REGIONS MAY ALSO PRODUCE ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET UNTIL SHORTLY AFTER
03/0600Z. THE FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS THEREAFTER.
THE GRADUAL ONSET OF THE DISTURBANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE LARGE
CORONAL HOLE IN THE NORTHERN SOLAR HEMISPHERE IS THE SOURCE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT DAY
OR SO. THE FIELD SHOULD RETURN TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS
BY THE THIRD DAY.
