JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 223 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7248 (S13W38)
PRODUCED TWO C1/SF FLARES. REGION 7245 (S06W73) ALSO PRODUCED
TWO C1/SF FLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7248 HAS CONTINUED TO DECAY. ITS MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY
HAS WEAKENED. ITS TOTAL AREA HAS DECREASED. IT STILL HAS
SLIGHT POTENTIAL TO LAUNCH AN M-CLASS FLARE. OTHER REGIONS
APPEAR TO BE STABLE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED EARLY IN THE PERIOD. A CORONAL HOLE
IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ACTIVITY ON 12 AND 13 AUGUST. PERIODS
OF ACTIVE LEVELS ARE LIKELY, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH LATITUDES.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPERATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20
        MINOR STORM                  05/05/01
        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           03/01/01
    A. HIGH LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       40/25/20

        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
