JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 288 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THERE WAS ONE C-CLASS
EVENT RECORDED TODAY, A C9 AT 1935Z. THIS X-RAY EMISSION WAS
THE RESULT OF AN EPL AT N12W90. MATERIAL FROM THE EPL WAS
VISIBLE TO .16 SOLAR RADII. REGION 7306 (S08W71) CONTINUED TO
DECAY AS IT NEARS WEST LIMB. TWO OTHER REGIONS, 7310 (N07E38)
AND 7311 (S17E45) BOTH DISPLAYED SOME GROWTH OVERNIGHT. ONE
NEW REGION WAS NUMBERED TODAY, 7312 AT N20E68.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. AT THE TIME OF THIS ISSUE THERE IS STILL NO INDICATION OF
A STRONG REGION BEYOND EAST LIMB. PERHAPS YESTERDAY'S FLARES,
LIKE TODAY'S, ORIGINATED FROM BEYOND WEST LIMB. ALTHOUGH
VERY SLIGHT, REGION 7110 HAS THE BEST CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS EVENT OF THE REGIONS NOW ON THE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BECOME MOSTLY ACTIVE ON THE FIRST DAY DUE TO A
SMALL CORONAL HOLE WHICH SHOULD BE IN A FAVORABLE POSITION AT
THAT TIME. BY DAY TWO CONDITIONS SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED
AGAIN. ANOTHER SMALL CORONAL HOLE IS DUE TO ROTATE INTO
POSITION ABOUT DAY FOUR. THIS COULD PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL
ACTIVE CONDITIONS.
