JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 178 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 JUN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE, DUE TO AN ISOLATED
M FLARE FROM REGION 7205 (N10W87) AT 0415UT.  SOLAR OBSERVERS
ARE REPORTING SOME INDICATIONS THAT THIS REGION IS BEGINNING
TO FRAGMENT AS IT APPROACHES WEST LIMB.  IT REMAINS LARGE
(OVER 1000 MILLIONTHS) AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX (BETA-GAMMA-
DELTA).  REMAINING REGIONS ARE SMALL AND RELATIVELY QUIET.
THE LARGE NORTH-SOUTH FILAMENT LOCATED NEAR N10W25 YESTERDAY
IS NO LONGER VISIBLE.  A LARGE CORONAL HOLE IS SITUATED
BETWEEN THIS FILAMENT LOCATION AND REGION 7205.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  M FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM REGION 7205.  ANOTHER
MAJOR FLARE IS POSSIBLE FROM THIS REGION DURING ITS WEST LIMB
TRANSIT.  OLD REGION 7186 (N11 L119), WHICH PRODUCED TWO M
FLARES LAST ROTATION, IS DUE BACK ON 28 JUN.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE PROTON AND PCA EVENTS
WHICH BEGAN YESTERDAY ARE STILL IN PROGRESS.  THE PEAK
P10 FLUX WAS 390PFU AT 0610UT.  THE MAXIMUM RIOMETER
ABSORPTION AT THULE WAS 5.6DB AT 0930UT.  THE P100 FLUX
REACHED A PEAK OF 14PFU AT 25/2100UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY IN THE PERIOD.  MAJOR
TO SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN EARLY ON
27 JUN AS A RESULT OF THE X3 FLARE YESTERDAY.  STORM CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH 28 JUN.  THE PARTICLE AND PCA
EVENTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE OVER THE NEXT 24 TO
48 HOURS.
