JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 163 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 JUN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7191 (N14W43) PRO-
DUCED TWO C1 FLARES TODAY. THE GROUP HAS SHOWN CONTINUED GROWTH
AND HAS MERGED WITH REGION 7193; THE TWO REGIONS HAVE BEEN
COMBINED INTO A SINGLE REGION 7191. AN ADDITIONAL C1 FLARE
OCCURRED TODAY OUT OF AN ACTIVE FILAMENT REGION JUST SOUTH-
EAST OF REGION 7194 NEAR S23E68. NEW REGION 7195 (S08E14)
EMERGED ON THE DISK TODAY AS A SIMPLE D-TYPE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
BE LOW. REGION 7191 IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MAIN SOURCE FOR OC-
CASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THERE IS A
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS. IN PARTICULAR A TRANSITION TO DISTURBED LEVELS
BEGAN AROUND 18Z WHICH RESULTED IN STRONGLY ACTIVE LEVELS AT
MID-LATITUDES AND MINOR STORM LEVELS CONDITIONS AT SOME HIGH
LATITUDE SITES. THIS INCREASE IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO EFFECTS
FROM THE M1 FLARE OF 08 JUNE, ALTHOUGH A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE MAY ALSO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE WITH PERIODS OF MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE
PERSISTS. CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED THERE-
AFTER, WITH POSSIBLE ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
