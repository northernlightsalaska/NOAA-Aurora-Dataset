SDF NUMBER 059 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7070 (N07W26), THE
SITE OF AN X3/3B FLARE YESTERDAY, COULD MUSTER BUT A C4/0F AT
1646Z IN THE PAST 24 HOURS. SOME DECAY AND SIMPLIFICATION HAS
OCCURRED THERE, BUT OVERALL THE REGION RETAINS A GOOD DEGREE OF
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED, 7081
(S12E44) AND 7082 (S09W51).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 7070 REMAINS THE PREMIER REGION FOR
ENERGETIC ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. YESTERDAY'S STORM ENDED
ABRUPTLY AROUND 0000Z. BOTH THE FORBUSH DECREASE AND THE
ENHANCEMENT IN THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUX
WEAKENED THROUGHOUT THE INTERVAL.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO ATTAIN MINOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS EARLY IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD. A SHOCK FROM THE X3/3B FLARE OF 27/0956Z IS
DUE IN THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS, INITIATING ANOTHER MAGNETIC
DISTURBANCE. THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO LAST 2-3 DAYS.
