JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 088 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 MAR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY A FEW LOW-LEVEL
C-CLASS SUBFLARES OCCURRED. THE LARGEST WAS A C2/SF FROM 7120
(S19E22) AT 1822Z. BOTH REGION 7120 AND 7117 (N07E03) SHOWED
SOME GROWTH TODAY. THE DEVELOPMENT IN 7117 BRINGS THE AREA TO
ABOUT 1010 MILLIONTHS. THE REGION SHOWS STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS
AND SOME AREA OF HIGH GRADIENTS, BUT REMAINS STABLE NONETHELESS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY LOW. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
M-FLARE FROM REGION 7117, ESPECIALLY IF SOME KIND OF TRIGGER OR
INSTABILITY EMERGES WITHIN THE REGION. REGION 7120 SHOULD CON-
TINUE TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL C-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A BRIEF
ACTIVE PERIOD OCCURRED FROM 0900-1030Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED.
