JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 238 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 25 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7260 (N14W103) HAS
PRODUCED NUMEROUS C-FLARES, THE LARGEST BEING A C8 AT 25/1920Z.
THE REGION RELEASED ENERGY MAINTAINING C-FLARE LEVELS FOR OVER
150 MINUTES DURING THE 1700-2030Z PERIOD. THE REST OF THE DISK
WAS EXTREMELY STABLE. ONE NEW REGION ASSIGNED: 7267 (N03E38).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW TO LOW. REGION 7260 WILL BE A DAY BEHIND THE LIMB AND
STILL HOLD THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR M-FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS AT MID-LATITUDES
AND AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF
THE PERIOD, AND INCREASE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE THIRD DAY.

BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPARATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:

        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
