JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 312 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7332 (S23W68) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY C-CLASS FLARE: A C3/1F AT 1634Z. THE EVENT
WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A MAGNETICALLY SIMPLE GROUP
AND WAS MARKED BY PARALLEL RIBBONS AND BRIGHT SURGING OF MATER-
IAL THAT COULD BE SEEN ON THE DISK AND SLIGHTLY BEYOND THE LIMB.
A REVIEW OF THE EVENT SHOWED ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISRUPTION OF
AN ACTIVE REGION FILAMENT OF 9 DEGREES EXTENT. REGION 7330
(S08W10) CONTINUES AS THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK AND
SHOWED MODEST GROWTH TODAY, BUT WAS QUIET. REGIONS 7334
(N13E47) AND 7335 (S17E50) SHOW MATURE SPOTS AND RESPECTABLE
SIZE BUT WERE STABLE. THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK AND LIMBS
WERE QUIET AND VOID OF ACTIVITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW, BUT WITH A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE
FROM REGION 7330. A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE BACKGROUND LEVELS
IS EXPECTED ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH DAYS AS OLD REGION 7315
(N06, L-130) WILL BE RETURNING AT THAT TIME. 7315 PRODUCED
3 M-CLASS FLARES DURING ITS PREVIOUS DISK TRANSIT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS. QUIET
TO UNSETTLED LEVELS DOMINATED MOST OF THE DAY BUT AN ACTIVE
PERIOD OCCURRED AT MID-LATITUDES FROM 0900-1200UT AND AT HIGH
LATITUDES FROM 0600-1800UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
THERE MAY BE OCCASIONAL BRIEF ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
