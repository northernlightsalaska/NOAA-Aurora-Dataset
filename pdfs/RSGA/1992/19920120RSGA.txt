JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 020 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 JAN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7016 (N04E51)
PRODUCED THE ONLY X-RAY FLARE OBSERVED OPTICALLY, A C1/SF AT
20/0348Z. THIS REGION IS THE LARGEST AND POSSIBLY THE MOST
COMPLEX ON THE DISK, AND IT APPEARS TO BE GROWING SLOWLY. THE
RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF REGION 7019 (N17W00) HAS DIMINISHED. THIS
REGION HAS PRODUCED SUBFLARES, BUT NONE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH
SIGNIFICANT X-RAYS. SEVERAL SMALL NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED-
7022 (N19E26), 7023 (S11E36), 7024 (S11E65), 7025 (S17E72),
AND 7026 (S14E84).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGIONS 7016 AND 7019 ARE THE MOST LIKELY FLARE PRODUCERS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
