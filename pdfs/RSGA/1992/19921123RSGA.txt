JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 328 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7348 (N13E61),
A RAPIDLY GROWING DAO GROUP, LED THE WAY WITH AN M1/2N FLARE
AT 22/2310UT. THIS REGION ALSO PROVIDED A VARIETY OF SMALLER
FLARES INCLUDING A C5/1N FLARE AT 23/0854UT. REGION 7347 (S07
W25) ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF SMALLER FLARES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH
WAS A C9/SN AT 23/0433UT. THIS REGION CONTINUED ITS GROWTH AS
WELL. REGION 7342 (S08W90) JOINED THE FRAY WITH A NUMBER OF
SUBFAINT FLARES INCLUDING A C4/SF AT 23/1359UT. AN M4 X-RAY
EVENT, POSSIBLY CORRELATED WITH A SUBFAINT FLARE AND LIMB
SURGE ON THE WEST LIMB IN REGION 7342, IS NOW IN PROGRESS. IT
MAXED AT 23/2031UT. REGIONS 7349 (S05E58), 7350 (S19E68) AND
7351 (S15E72) WERE NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 7347 AND 7348 HAVE THE BEST POTENTIAL
FOR M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY. BOTH REGIONS ALSO HAVE A SMALL
CHANCE OF PRODUCING AN ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ALL LATITUDES SAW PERIODS OF
MINOR STORM LEVELS. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS ALSO EXPERIENCED
A SHORT PERIOD OF MAJOR STORMING. ACTIVITY IS DUE TO A
FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, THEN
UNSETTLED AS THE CORONAL HOLE MOVES WEST.
