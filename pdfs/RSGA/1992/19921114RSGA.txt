JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 319 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. ALL DISK REGIONS
ARE SMALL AND MAGNETICALLY SIMPLE. THE ONLY FLARE TODAY WAS
A SF AT 14/1622Z WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT X-RAY OUTPUT. THIS FLARE
ORIGINATED NEAR NEW REGION 7342 (S07E36). NEW REGIONS 7341
(S16E04) AND 7343 (N11E51) WERE ALSO NUMBERED. HIGH CORONAL
LOOPS OBSERVED IN X-RAY IMAGERY ARE MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH
RETURNING REGION 7321 (S25,L-70). H-ALPHA AND WHITE LIGHT
EVIDENCE OF THIS REGION HAVE NOT YET APPEARED AT THE EAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. ACTIVITY SHOULD INCREASE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH THE
RETURN OF REGION 7321.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
