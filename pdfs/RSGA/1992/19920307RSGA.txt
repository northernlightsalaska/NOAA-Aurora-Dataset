JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 067 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 MAR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7093 (S24E67)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE PAST DAY, A C5/SF AT 07/
0213Z. REGION 7091 (S09E57) ALSO PRODUCED LOW LEVEL C-CLASS
ACTIVITY. THE ACTIVE REGIONS CURRENTLY ON THE DISK ARE
RELATIVELY SMALL. REGION 7091 IS POSSIBLY THE MOST COMPLEX
AND IS LOCATED IN THE DECAYING MAGNETIC FIELDS OF OLD REGION
7056. THREE SMALL NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED- 7094 (N15E65),
7095 (N16W18), AND 7096 (S05E20).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN
REGIONS 7091 AND 7093.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A PROTON
ENHANCEMENT AT SATELLITE ALTITUDES BEGAN AT ABOUT 07/1400Z.
THE ENHANCEMENT HAS NOT REACHED EVENT THRESHOLD. THE SOURCE
OF THE PROTONS IS NOT CERTAIN, ALTHOUGH THE LONG DURATION
C6 AT 05/2247Z IS A POSSIBILITY. THIS FLARE WAS NOT CORRELATED
TO AN OPTICAL FLARE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BECOME ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS DUE TO A
CORONAL HOLE. THE PROTON ENHANCEMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO REACH
EVENT LEVEL.
