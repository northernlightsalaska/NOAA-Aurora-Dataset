JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 048 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7056 (S13W38)
CONTINUED TO SLOWLY DEVELOP AND PRODUCED A LONG DURATION M4/2N
FLARE AT 17/0128Z. A DELTA MAGNETIC STRUCTURE WAS OBSERVED
WITHIN THE LEADER PORTION OF THE REGION. REGION 7050 (N13W77)
PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS FLARES: AN M1/SF AT 17/1546Z AND AN M1/SF
AT 17/1657Z. THIS REGION CONTINUED TO GRADUALLY DECAY. REGION
7058 (N14W45) CONTINUED TO GROW AND PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES
TWO OF WHICH REACHED C-CLASS. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 7056 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES AND MAY ALSO PRODUCE A MAJOR FLARE. REGIONS 7050 AND
7058 MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 25 NANOTESLA
WAS RECORDED BY THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER AT 17/0805Z.
ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM
17/1500-1800Z. THIS ACTIVITY MAY HAVE BEEN IN RESPONSE TO
THE M5/1B FLARE THAT OCCURRED AT 15/2139Z. THE FIELD HAD
DECLINED TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE END OF THE
PERIOD. A GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON ENHANCEMENT BEGAN NEAR
17/1200Z. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE WAS THE LONG DURATION M4/2N
FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE. THE ENHANCEMENT WAS GRADUALLY
DECREASING TOWARD BACKGROUND LEVELS BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS IN
RESPONSE TO THE M4/2N FLARE THAT OCCURRED AT 17/0128Z. THE
FIELD IS EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS DURING
THE FINAL DAY.
