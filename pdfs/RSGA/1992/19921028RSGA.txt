SDF NUMBER 302 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7321 (S25W42) WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE C-CLASS FLARES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS
A C2/1F AT 28/1034UT WITH AN ASSOCIATED TYPE II AND IV SWEEP.
REGION 7323 (S13E14) PRODUCED A SINGLE C-CLASS FLARE. BOTH
REGIONS SHOWED CONTINUED GROWTH.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7321 HAS THE BEST M-CLASS POTENTIAL AND STILL HAS
A CHANCE OF PRODUCING AN ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARE THAT COULD
PRODUCE A ENERGETIC PROTONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. LOW LATITUDE STATIONS SAW A
SHORT PERIOD OF MINOR STORM LEVELS WHILE HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS
EXPERIENCED BRIEF MAJOR STORM LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE. FLARE AND DSF EFFECTS ARE EXPECTED TO
KEEP LEVELS ELEVATED THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.
