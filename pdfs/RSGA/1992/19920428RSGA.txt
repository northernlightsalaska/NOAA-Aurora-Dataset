JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 119 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE ONLY FLARE ACTIVITY
HAS BEEN MINOR CLASS-C SUBFLARES.  REGION 7143 (S06W05) REMAINS
COMPLEX WITH A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION BUT THE
REGION INCLUDES ONLY A SMALL PLAGE AREA AND LITTLE ASSOCIATED
STRUCTURE AROUND IT.  SIMPLE NEW REGIONS HAVE APPEAR AT S06 E21
(REGION 7149) AND AT S08 E12 (REGION 7150).  THERE HAVE BEEN
REPORTS OF RAPID BUT LIMITED GROWTH IN 7150.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW WITH FREQUENT, MINOR FLARES IN ANY OF SEVERAL DISK REGIONS.
THE BEST CHANCE OF A CLASS-M FLARE APPEARS TO BE REGION 7143.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.  THE BEST PROSPECT FOR
ACTIVITY APPEARS TO BE A SMALL POSITIVE-POLARITY CORONAL HOLE
CENTERED NEAR N20 W10.  THERE IS CONFLICTING EVIDENCE WHETHER
IT IS CONNECTED TO THE NORTHERN POLAR HOLE.
