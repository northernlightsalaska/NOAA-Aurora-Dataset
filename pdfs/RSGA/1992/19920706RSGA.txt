JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 188 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 JUL 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7220 (S12E63)
PRODUCED 3 M-CLASS EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD: AN M1/SF AT 2212Z,
AN M1/1N AT 2341Z AND AN M3/1F AT 0154Z. THE GROUP APPEARS TO
BE A MODERATE SIZED (360 MILLIONTHS) E-TYPE GROUP WITH A SIMPLE
BETA CONFIGURATION ALTHOUGH LIMB PROXIMITY MADE ANALYSIS DIF-
FICULT. A 10 DEGREE SURGE AREA WAS REPORTED ON EAST LIMB BEHIND
7220, HINTING AT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF YET ANOTHER REGION
TO COME. REGION 7216 (N14W20) CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST GROUP
ON THE DISK, BUT SHOWED DECAY AND LOST ITS DELTA CONFIGURATION.
7216 PRODUCED ONLY A COUPLE OF C-CLASS SUBFLARES DURING THE
PERIOD. AN ACTIVE PROMINENCE WAS NOTED ON WEST LIMB AT S17,
EXTENDING JUST OVER .2 RADII BEYOND THE SOLAR LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE. REGION 7220 IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST
LIKELY SOURCE FOR M-CLASS LEVEL ACTIVITY. REGION 7216 ALSO
REMAINS RESPECTABLE AND COULD PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-EVENT
AS WELL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET. SOME ISOLATED
PERIODS OF UNSETTLED LEVELS WERE REPORTED AT HIGH
LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. AN INCREASE TO ACTIVE
LEVELS IS ANTICIPATED SOMETIME LATE TOMORROW AND LASTING
THROUGH THE SECOND DAY IN RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE.
