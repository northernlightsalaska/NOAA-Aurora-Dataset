IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. SEVERAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES
OCCURRED. REGION 7100 (S16E38) DISPLAYED A MINOR INCREASE IN
SPOT COUNT AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST
SUBFLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 7096 (S05W65) ALSO SHOWED MINOR
GROWTH. REGION 7091 (S10W22) RETAINED A WEAK DELTA MAGNETIC
STRUCTURE WITHIN ITS LEADER SPOTS, BUT WAS STABLE DURING THE
PERIOD. REGIONS 7104 (S24E06) AND 7105 (S17W04) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW. C-CLASS SUBFLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM REGIONS 7091
AND 7100. BOTH REGIONS ALSO POSE A SLIGHT THREAT FOR ISOLATED
M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS.
AN INCREASE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS IS EXPECTED ON THE
FINAL DAY BASED UPON THE RECURRENT PATTERN.
