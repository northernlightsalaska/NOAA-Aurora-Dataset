JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 053 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7070 (N07E56)
PRODUCED AN M2/1F FLARE AT 21/2206Z. THE OPTICAL SIZE OF THE
EVENT WAS ESTIMATED AT THE BOULDER OBSERVATORY. LITTLE GROWTH
WAS NOTED IN THE REGION, HOWEVER IT IS BECOMING MORE COMPLEX.
REGION 7072 (S10E59) PRODUCED A C7/1N FLARE AT 22/1046Z.
ISOLATED SUBFLARING WAS OBSERVED IN REGIONS 7067 (N05E28) AND
7071 (S05W32). 7067 DISPLAYED NOTABLE OVERNIGHT GROWTH. A LARGE,
31 DEGREE LONG SEGMENT OF FILAMENT DISAPPEARED BETWEEN 21/2300Z
AND 2330Z. THE FILAMENT WAS PART OF A SOLAR SECTOR BOUNDARY
WHICH BISECTED REGION 7073 (S15W51), AN AREA THAT EMERGED ALONG
THIS BOUNDARY DURING THE LAST 36 HOURS. REGIONS 7074 (N16E70)
AND 7075 (N15E17) WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 7070 AND 7076 CONTINUE TO POSE THE GREATEST
THREAT FOR M-FLARE PRODUCTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THROUGH THE 24TH. ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE BY THE 25TH IN RESPONSE TO
EFFECTS FROM THE FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE NOTED ABOVE.
