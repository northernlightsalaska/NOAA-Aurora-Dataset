JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 126 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 MAY 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  REGION 7154 (S26E39)
HAS PRODUCED ANOTHER CLASS M1 FLARE.  THE X-RAY EVENT WAS
MARKED BY A SLOW, IRREGULAR RISE, INDICATING SMALL BUT
COMPLEX STRUCTURES WERE INVOLVED IN THE EVENT.  THE REGION HAS
A SMALL, COMPACT, AND GROWING SUNSPOT STRUCTURE.  THE MAGNETIC
STRUCTURE HAS BEEN SIMPLE.  THE REGION WOULD APPEAR TO BE A
YOUNG, GROWING REGION EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT.  HOWEVER, IT
IS SURROUNDED AND CONNECTED TO A NETWORK OF FILAMENTS TYPICAL OF
A MORE MATURE REGION.  IT HAS PRODUCED FREQUENT, SMALL
CLASS C FLARES.  REGION 7150 (S06W61) HAS PRODUCED CLASS C
SUBFLARES AS WELL.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT IN REGION 7154, COUPLED
WITH ITS RECORD OF FREQUENT FLARES, INDICATE IT MAY BECOME A
SOURCE OF MAJOR (GREATER THAN CLASS M5) FLARES IN THE NEXT DAY
OR SO AND CONTINUE AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF SIGNIFICANT
GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT 10 DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED. THERE ARE CONTRADICTORY INDICATIONS
WHETHER THE LONG DURATION FLARES OF THE PAST TWO DAYS WILL
PRODUCE INCREASED GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY.  THE COMPLEX,
SLOW X-RAY TIME PROFILES INDICATE YES BUT THE LACK OF ASSOCIATED
RADIO BURSTS INDICATE NO.
