JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 109 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THE FIRST M-CLASS
FLARE SINCE 01 APRIL, AN M1/0F AT 17/2327Z, ORIGINATED IN REGION
7135 (S16E54). THE REGION CONTINUED TO GENERATE SMALLER FLARES
TODAY, ALTHOUGH ITS PACE HAS SLOWED LATELY. STRONG ARCH-
FILAMENTS AND CONTINUED SLOW GROWTH HAVE BEEN REPORTED, WITH THE
HOTTEST PLAGE NEAR THE TRAILER SPOTS. MORE EAST LIMB ACTIVITY
AND THE POSSIBLE ARRIVAL OF MORE ACTIVE CENTERS MARK THE ARRIVAL
OF AN ACTIVE BAND OF LONGITUDES THAT INCLUDE REGION 7135 AND
NEWLY ASSIGNED REGION 7137 (S18E69). A SMALL FILAMENT
DISAPPEARED FROM THIS SAME AREA (N10E70) AROUND 1700Z. THE 10.7
CM RADIO FLUX TOOK ANOTHER LARGE JUMP, SURPASSING THE 200 LEVEL
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 01 MARCH.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7135 IS THE PRIME CANDIDATE FOR AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE. REGIONS 7137, 7132 (S27E16) AND 7128
(S14W48) MAY YIELD SMALLER FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
SOME ACTIVE CONDITIONS OCCURRED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT 48 HOURS. CORONAL
HOLE EFFECTS ARE DUE DURING THAT TIME. STRICTLY UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS SHOULD END THE INTERVAL.
