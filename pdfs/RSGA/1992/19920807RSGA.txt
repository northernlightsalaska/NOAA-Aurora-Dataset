JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 220 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7248 (S11E03) AND
REGION 7251 (S17W02) CONTINUE TO DOMINATE C-CLASS FLARE
PRODUCTION. THE PEAK FLARE OF THE DAY WAS A C3/SN FROM REGION
7248/7251 COMPLEX AT 07/2101UT. THIS COMPLEX SEEMS TO BE
DECAYING DURING THIS PERIOD. A LARGE PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED
ON THE NORTHEAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. ALTHOUGH SLOWLY DECREASING IN MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY, REGION 7248/7251 COMPLEX STILL HAS POTENTIAL TO
PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS AT MID-LATITUDES FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. AT HIGH
LATITUDES THE FIELD RANGED FROM ACTIVE TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN
06/1145Z ENDED AT 06/1650Z. LEVELS CONTINUE TO DECLINE
TOWARD BACKGROUND TODAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS DUE TO A WELL
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE. SEVERAL FILAMENT ERUPTIONS AND CORONAL
MASS EJECTIONS MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACTIVITY.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPERATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20
        MINOR STORM                  05/05/01

        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
