JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 281 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7306 (S08E23)
PRODUCED 4 M-CLASS FLARES DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE EVENTS
CONSISTED OF; AN M3/1B WITH TYPE II AT 0507Z, AN M1/1N AT 0759Z,
AN M1/1B AT 1012Z, AND AN M1/1N AT 1504Z. THE REGION HAS GROWN
IN WHITE LIGHT AND HAS ASSUMED A MODERATE DEGREE OF MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. THE OTHER 6 SPOTTED REGIONS ON THE DISK WERE LARGELY
UNCHANGED AND GENERATED LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7306 IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE M-CLASS FLARES,
AND REGION 7303 (S13W22) MAY INTERJECT ITS OWN ENERGETIC
ACTIVITY IF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OCCURS THERE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
EPISODIC ACTIVE CONDITIONS OCCURRED IN NIGHTTIME SECTORS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. A SMALL CORONAL
HOLE MAY CAUSE SOME BRIEF DISTURBED TIMES MIDWAY-TO-LATE IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD.
