JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 282 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7306 (S10E10)
REMAINED THE DOMINANT FLARE SITE TODAY, BUT COULD MUSTER JUST
A C8/1N AT 0434Z AS ITS LARGEST EVENT. IT HAD NUMEROUS LESSER
SIZE FLARES AS IT STAYED BRIGHT IN H-ALPHA AND MAGNETICALLY
COMPLEX. REGION 7303 (S14W34) ALSO PRODUCED FREQUENT C-CLASS
FLARES WHILE SHOWING A WEAK DELTA IN ITS INTERMEDIATE SPOTS.
THE REMAINING 5 SPOTTED REGIONS DID NOT IMPRESS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN LESS VOLATILE THAN YESTERDAY,
REGION 7306 RETAINS THE POTENTIAL FOR M-CLASS FLARES AND, TO
A LESSER EXTENT, REGION 7303 DOES TOO.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A SUDDEN
IMPULSE OF 14 NANOTESLA AT BOULDER OCCURRED AT 1840Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
