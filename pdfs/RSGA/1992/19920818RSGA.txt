JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 231 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7260 (N17W11),
LARGE AND OMINOUS, HAD JUST C-CLASS FLARES DURING THE PERIOD.
THE SUNSPOT GROUP MEASURES ABOUT 1000 MILLIONTHS IN WHITE
LIGHT AREA, AND DISPLAYS A MIXTURE OF MAGNETIC POLARITIES AT
VARIOUS POINTS WITHIN THE CLUSTER OF SPOTS. THE THREE OTHER
SPOTTED REGIONS PALE BY COMPARISON AND HAVE BEEN LARGELY
UNPRODUCTIVE. A LARGE DARK FILAMENT, CENTERED NEAR N45W15 AND
SPANNING 30 DEGREES, DISAPPEARED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE DAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7260 MAY YIELD AN M-CLASS EVENT OVER
THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET. THE ANTICIPATED CORONAL HOLE-
RELATED DISTURBANCE DID NOT OCCUR.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED. TODAY'S HIGH LATITUDE
DISAPPEARING FILAMENT IS NOT EXPRECTED TO BE GEO-EFFECTIVE.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPARATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20

        MAJOR-SEVERE STORM           05/01/01

THE ACTIVITY LEVEL FOR THE DAY FOR THESE FORECASTS
IS DETERMINED BY THE MAXIMUM K-INDEX (3 HOURLY PERIOD)
OBSERVED DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD. CALL SESC FOR MORE
