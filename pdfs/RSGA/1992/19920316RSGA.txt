JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 076 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 MAR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW WITH OCCASIONAL SCATTERED
CLASS C FLARES IN REGIONS 7104 (S25W31) AND 7091 (S09W62). A
NEW REGION (7108, N04E73) HAS ROTATED INTO VIEW.  IT IS THE
RETURN OF OLD REGION 7067 THAT PRODUCED 4 CLASS M FLARES.
THERE IS EXTENSIVE MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE REGION BUT
THE SPOT IS A SIMPLE H-TYPE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  ISOLATED CLASS M FLARES MAY OCCUR IN REGION 7099
AND 7100.  THE LARGE, OLD MAGNETIC STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH
REGION 7108 MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE A RAPID RISE IN THE
10.7 CM RADIO FLUX.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE LEVELS WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH
LATITUDES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE PERIOD. THE SATELLITE
LEVEL PROTON FLUX AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV BARELY EXCEEDED THE
10 PFU EVENT THRESHOLD FROM 16/0840-1100Z. THE FLUX GRADUALLY
DECLINED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE
FIRST DAY IN RESPONSE TO THE M7/3B FLARE OF 15 MARCH. THE
FIELD IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
