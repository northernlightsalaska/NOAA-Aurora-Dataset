IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGIONS 7220 (S12W14) AND
7222 (S11W00) REMAINED THE LARGEST AND MOST ACTIVE SUNSPOT
GROUPS ON THE DISK. BOTH REGIONS PRODUCED A NUMBER OF SUBFLARES.
THESE REGIONS ARE OF SIMILAR SIZE AND BOTH APPEAR TO HAVE DELTA
CONFIGURATIONS. REGION 7227 (N12E57) IS A SMALL AND INACTIVE
SUNSPOT GROUP. IT IS ALL THAT REMAINS OF OLD REGION 7205.
NEW REGIONS 7228 (S02E43) AND 7229 (N26E59) WERE NUMBERED.

MODERATE. M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS LIKELY FROM THE 7220/7222 COMPLEX.
MAJOR FLARES ARE POSSIBLE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET UNTIL ABOUT 12/0500Z
WHEN IT GRADUALLY BECAME DISTURBED. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
CONDITIONS FOLLOWED. THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURBANCE IS PROBABLY
A CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE BECOMING QUIET TO UNSETTLED
BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE
SUBSIDES.
