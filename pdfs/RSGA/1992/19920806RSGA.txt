JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 219 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7248 (S12E15)
PRODUCED SEVERAL LOW C-CLASS FLARES. THE DELTA CONFIGURATION IN
THIS REGION FADED. REGION 7251 (S18E15) PRODUCED THE
LARGEST EVENT OF THE PERIOD - A C5/SN AT 05/2129Z. MAGNETICALLY,
THESE TWO REGIONS ARE INTERTWINED AND MANY FLARES ARE "SHARED."
A SMALL REGION EMERGED AT N19W23 AND WAS NUMBERED AS 7253.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BECOME
MODERATE. REGION 7248 IS OVERDUE FOR A SMALL CLASS M FLARE IN
SPITE OF THE DECAY IN THE AREA OF THE DELTA CONFIGURATION. A
MAJOR FLARE FROM THE 7248/7251 COMPLEX REMAINS AS A SLIGHT
POSSIBILITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED UNTIL A SUDDEN
IMPULSE OF 16 GAMMA OCCURRED AT 06/0427Z. AFTERWARD, ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS PREVAILED. TOWARD THE END OF THE
PERIOD, MOSTLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED. A
CONTINUATION OF THE PROTON ENHANCEMENT FINALLY PASSED EVENT
THRESHOLD AT 06/1145Z. THE MAXIMUM FLUX OBSERVED WAS 14PFU
(GT 10MEV) AT 06/1210Z. PROTON FLUXES HOVERED NEAR THE
10PFU LEVEL FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. A FORBUSH
DECREASE BEGAN NEAR 06/0500Z AND REACHED A MAXIMUM OF
APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT DURING THE DAY.  BELOW EVENT LEVEL
POLAR CAP ABSORPTION ACCOMPANIED THE INCREASE IN PROTON
FLUX ABOVE. MAXIMUM ABSORPTION WAS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 1DB.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR 07 AUG AS THE CURRENT
DISTURBANCE SUBSIDES. SIMILAR CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR
08-09 AUG DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF A SMALL CORONAL HOLE.
THE PROTON EVENT AND SUB-EVENT LEVEL POLAR CAP ABSORPTION
SHOULD SLOWLY DECAY OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPERATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
