JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 127 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 MAY 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE MOST INTENSE FLARE
OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS WAS A CLASS C3 EVENT AT 06/1000UT WITH
NO OPTICAL COUNTERPART REPORTED.  MINOR FLARES UP TO CLASS C2
HAVE OCCURRED IN REGIONS 7150 (S06 WEST LIMB) AND 7154 (S25
E28).  THE LATTER REGION HAS GROWN SLOWLY IN SUNSPOT AREA.
MT WILSON MAGNETIC DATA SHOWS IT TO BE BETA-GAMMA.  THE
FILAMENTS EXTENDING INTO THE REGION APPEAR LESS DISTINCT THAN
24 TO 48 HOURS AGO WHILE A LARGE FILAMENT EXTENDING TOWARD THE
EAST LIMB FROM NEAR THE REGION APPEARS AS IF IT MAY BE READY TO
LIFT FROM THE DISK.  ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE SUN, SMALL,
SIMPLE SUNSPOT GROUPS CONTINUE TO APPEAR FOR A FEW HOURS, THEN
FADE FROM SIGHT.  THE IMPLICATION OF THIS PHENOMENON IS UNKNOWN
TO ORDINARY FORECASTERS AND OBSERVERS.  THE 10.7 CM RADIO FLUX
HAS HOVERED IN THE RANGE 130 TO 140 FOR THE PAST 9
DAYS.  VETERAN SOLAR CYCLE OBSERVERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THIS
LULL, MOVING TO LOWER FLUX VALUES AT THESE SOLAR LONGITUDES FOR
SEVERAL ROTATIONS, MARK THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST, STEEP
DECLINE FROM THE PLATEAU OF HIGH VALUES THAT HAVE HELD
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 1989. THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE OF THE
CURRENT FACE OF THE SUN IS MARKED BY A VERY LARGE AREA DEVOID
OF SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURES OF ANY KIND.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 7154 MAY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, THOUGH
AT A SLOWER RATE.  IT REMAINS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF
ENERGETIC ACTIVITY.  IF THE PRESENT DECLINE OF 10.7 CM FLUX
CONTINUES, IT WILL BE THE FIRST OF SEVERAL THAT WILL MARK THE
DECLINE OF THE PRESENT CYCLE TO MINIMUM OVER THE NEXT 4 OR
5 YEARS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THOUGH NOT A DISTURBANCE AT THIS POINT,
GROUND-BASED AND GEOSYNCHRONOUS SATELLITE MAGNETOMETERS
BEGAN SHOWING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PATTERN, SHIFTING FROM
SMOOTH TO A SMALL BUT DISTINCT LEVEL OF DISTURBANCE THAT
MAY MARK THE FIRST EFFECTS OF THE VERY-LONG-DURATION X-RAY
EVENT THAT OCCURRED ON MAY 4.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET BUT WITH A CHANCE OF UNSETTLED-TO-
ACTIVE CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS FOLLOWED
BY A RETURN TO QUIET LEVELS.
