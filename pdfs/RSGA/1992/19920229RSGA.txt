JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 060 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7072 (S10W30)
HAD THE DAY'S SOLE M-CLASS FLARE, AN M1/2B AT 2047Z. THIS WAS
THE ONLY FLARE PRODUCED BY THE REGION. REGION 7067 (N03W68),
STILL THE LARGEST SPOT GROUP VISIBLE, HAD A FEW C-CLASS EVENTS.
REGION 7070 (N08W40) WAS QUIET AND SEEMED TO CONTINUE ITS
DECAY PHASE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES MAY OCCUR IN REGIONS 7067,
7070, OR 7072.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF AN
INTERPLANETARY SHOCK AT 0920Z. THE SUDDEN IMPULSE MEASURED
17 NANOTESLA AT BOULDER. THE X3/3B FLARE OF 27/0956Z IS THE
LIKELY SOURCE OF THE SHOCK. PERIODS OF MINOR TO SEVERE STORM
CONDITIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST 12 HOURS. GOES-7 HAD A
BRIEF TRANSIT OF THE MAGNETOPAUSE AROUND 1540Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE CURRENT
DISTURBANCE ABATES. A CORONAL HOLE, NOW CENTERED NEAR S05 AT
CENTRAL MERIDIAN, MAY BRING SLIGHTLY ELEVATED LEVELS OF
ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE INTERVAL.
