JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 030 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 JAN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 7031 (S05W08) LEAD
THE WAY PRODUCING 3 ENERGETIC EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD. AN M4/2B
TENFLARE AT 0939Z AND A LONG DURATION M2/1B FLARE WITH TYPE II
AND IV RADIO SWEEPS AT 1954Z WERE THE MOST NOTABLE. THE SWEEPS
WERE OF MODERATE INTENSITY AND THE TENFLARE BURST MEASURED 590
SFU. THIS REGION CONTINUED TO SHOW GROWTH IN SIZE WHILE BECOMING
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. REGION 7039 (S14E51) ALSO SHOWED INCREASED
SIZE AND COMPLEXITY. AN M1/1F FLARE ERUPTED IN REGION 7026
(S14W52) AT 1400Z. THIS AREA HAS BEEN IN DECLINE DURING THE LAST
FEW DAYS. INCREASED GROWTH AND COMPLEXITY WAS NOTED IN REGION
7033 (S11E12) WHICH CONTRIBUTED NUMEROUS SUBFLARES THROUGHOUT
THE PERIOD. NEW REGION 7042 (S14E70) WAS ASSIGNED. THIS AREA HAS
ALREADY SHOWN SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY WITH AN M1/SN FLARE AND A
LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM TO ITS CREDIT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. MORE M-CLASS FLARES ARE LIKELY WITH REGIONS
7031 AND 7039 PROVIDING THE GREATEST THREAT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE ON THE 31ST. ACTIVE TO STORM
CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ON 1 FEBRUARY IN RESPONSE TO REGION
7031'S LONG DURATION M2 FLARE. THE FIELD SHOULD RETURN TO MOSTLY
UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.
