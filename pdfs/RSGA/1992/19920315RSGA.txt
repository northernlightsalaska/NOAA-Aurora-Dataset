IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON ENHANCEMENT
FOLLOWED THE M7/3B FLARE. IT BEGAN NEAR 15/0600Z AND REACHED
A MAXIMUM OF ABOUT 4 PFU NEAR 15/1300Z. FLUX LEVELS REMAINED
ENHANCED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST DAY. ACTIVE LEVELS
ARE EXPECTED ON THE SECOND DAY DUE TO THE M7/3B FLARE. THE
FIELD SHOULD SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS ON THE FINAL
