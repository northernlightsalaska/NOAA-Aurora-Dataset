SDF NUMBER 091 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 MAR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7116 (S09W42)

C-CLASS FLARES. THE RATE OF GROWTH IN REGION 7122 (S12W29) HAS
SUBSIDED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. AN ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARE IS POSSIBLE IN
REGION 7116. REGION 7117 MAY YET PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
