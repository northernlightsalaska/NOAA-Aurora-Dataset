JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 058 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 7070 (N07W12)
PRODUCED A SURPRISING X3/3B TENFLARE AT 0956Z. ASSOCIATED RADIO
INCLUDED A BURST OF 8,300 SFU AT 2695 MHZ, AND BOTH TYPES II
AND IV SWEEP. THIS FLARE WAS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY LARGE FOR
THIS REGION, GIVEN THE SIZE AND FREQUENCY OF ITS RECENT FLARE
OUTPUT. HOWEVER, PRIOR TO THIS EVENT IT DID YIELD AN M1/1N
FLARE AT 26/2342Z. THE REGION HAS BEEN VERY QUIET SINCE THE
MAJOR FLARE, BUT SEEMS TO RETAIN TIGHT MAGNETIC GRADIENTS ALONG
A SHEARED EAST-WEST NEUTRAL LINE. OTHER ACTIVITY DURING THE
INTERVAL INCLUDED AN EPL FROM S43W90 AT 0739Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 7070 IS THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR FLARE
ACTIVITY IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS. VECTOR MAGNETOGRAM DATA
INDICATE THE REGION HAS NOT SIMPLIFIED SINCE THE X3/3B FLARE
EARLIER TODAY. THEREFORE, WATCH FOR INFREQUENT BUT STRONG
FLARES FROM THIS SITE. ALSO, REGION 7067 (N04W40) IS DUE FOR
ITS OWN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY MINOR STORM LEVELS
THE PAST 24 HOURS. A FORBUSH DECREASE BEGAN EARLY IN THE
INTERVAL AND IS IN PROGRESS. NEUTRON COUNTS ARE APPROXIMATELY
9 PERCENT BELOW NORMAL. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON
ENHANCEMENT WAS FURTHER FUELED BY THE X3 FLARE, REACHING
FLUXES JUST SHY OF THE 10 PFU REQUIRED FOR A FORMAL EVENT.
SLOW DECAY IS EVIDENT IN THE PROTONS AT THIS TIME.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT MINOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
ANOTHER SHOCK, THIS FROM THE X3 FLARE, IS EXPECTED EARLY ON
29 FEBRUARY. MINOR TO SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS SHOULD SOON
FOLLOW THE SHOCK'S ARRIVAL AND LINGER THROUGH THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. THE CURRENT FORBUSH DECREASE SHOULD CONTINUE
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON ENHANCEMENT
COULD GO EITHER WAY. MORE M OR X CLASS FLARES FROM REGION
7070 COULD EASILY DRIVE THE FLUXES INTO EVENT LEVEL. IF NO
MORE SIGNIFICANT FLARES OCCUR, THE FLUXES SHOULD CONTINUE
THEIR SLOW DECLINE.
