JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 165 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 JUN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7191 (N12W70) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY C-CLASS FLARE: A C1/SF AT 1259Z. REGION 7194
(S12E26) WAS COMBINED WITH 7198 INTO A SINGLE REGION 7194 TODAY
AS THE TWO GROUPS ARE MAGNETICALLY CONNECTED. A NEW H-TYPE SPOT
ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY AS 7201 AT N26E72. THE OTHER SOLAR
ACTIVE REGIONS WERE ALL QUIET AND UNREMARKABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7191 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE OCCASIONAL C-CLASS
FLARES OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS AS IT TRANSITS THE WEST LIMB.
REGION 7194 MIGHT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY IF NEW FLUX
EMERGES AND PERTURBS THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION. THERE IS A
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT FROM ONE OF THESE
TWO REGIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH OCCASIONAL
BRIEF ACTIVE PERIODS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED TOMORROW, UNSETTLED TO
ACTIVE ON THE SECOND DAY, AND GENERALLY UNSETTLED ON THE THIRD
DAY. THE INCREASE ON THE SECOND DAY IS ANTICIPATED AS A RE-
SPONSE TO DISAPPEARING FILAMENTS OF 12 JUNE AND A FAVORABLY
