IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. SEVERAL OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED C-CLASS X-RAY FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE PAST 24
HOURS. THE LARGEST WAS A FAIRLY LONG DURATION C6 AT 05/2247Z.
X-RAY IMAGES SUGGEST THAT EAST LIMB REGIONS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THESE FLARES. NEW REGIONS 7092 (S18E09) AND 7093 (S25E77)
WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE CHANCE OF M-CLASS ACTIVITY WILL INCREASE
AS NEW ACTIVE REGIONS ROTATE AROUND THE EAST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ON THE SECOND AND THIRD DAY OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO A CORONAL HOLE.
