IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. REGION 7191 (N12W58)
APPEARS TO HAVE STABILIZED FROM ITS INITIAL GROWTH PHASE AND
DID NOT PRODUCE ANY FLARES. REGION 7194 (S11E37) SHOWED SOME
GROWTH BUT ONLY PRODUCED TWO SUBFLARES. SLIGHT GROWTH WAS
NOTED IN REGION 7192 (N11W33). NEW REGION 7197 (S11E66)
ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY AS A SIMPLE H-TYPE GROUP. TWO
FILAMENTS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT DURING THE
PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7191, 7192 AND 7194 APPEAR TO BE THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCES FOR C-LEVEL FLARE ACTIVITY. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE
FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MOSTLY ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS DURING THE PERIOD. ACTIVITY WAS PARTICULARLY ENHANCED
FROM 1200-1800Z AS MID-LATITUDES EXPERIENCED MINOR STORM
LEVEL ACTIVITY AND HIGH LATITUDES REPORTED MAJOR TO SEVERE
STORM CONDITIONS. ACTIVITY APPEARED TO BE DIMINISHING NEAR
THE END OF THE DAY. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR THIS DIS-
TURBANCE WAS THE C4/TYPE II FLARE/SWEEP OF 09 JUNE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS AS THE CUR-
RENT DISTURBANCE PERSISTS. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE
TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED LEVELS WITH OCCASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS
THEREAFTER AND THROUGH THE END OF THE 2ND DAY. AN INCREASE
TO MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS IS POSSIBLE BY THE THIRD DAY IN
