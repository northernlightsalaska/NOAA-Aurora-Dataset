IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7276 (N15E13), THE
DOMINANT SPOT GROUP NOW ON THE DISK, HAD BUT A FEW C-CLASS

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7276 MAY GENERATE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET AT MID-LATITUDES AND
UNSETTLED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THE FIRST PART
OF THE PERIOD DUE TO A TRANS-EQUATORIAL CORONAL HOLE NOW
SITUATED NEAR W40. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD END THE INTERVAL.
