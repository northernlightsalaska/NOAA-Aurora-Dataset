JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 026 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 JAN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 7012 (S17W69), A
SMALL, SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT SPOT AREA, PRODUCED AN X1/3B
TENFLARE AT 26/1533Z. THE TENFLARE MEASURED 360 SFU. THE REGION
DISPLAYED SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN GROWTH/DECAY OVER THE LAST FEW
DAYS, BUT HAS REMAINED VERY SIMPLE. REGION 7031 (S04E44) GREW
SLIGHTLY DURING THE PERIOD AND PRODUCED AN M1/SB FLARE AT
26/0001Z. C-CLASS SUBFLARING WAS NOTED IN REGIONS 7030 (N07E48)
AND 7026 (S13E02). 7026 IS SHOWING SOME INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY.
NEW REGION 7033 (S12E65) WAS ASSIGNED
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM REGIONS 7026
AND 7031 WITH THE LATTER POSING A SLIGHT THREAT FOR M-CLASS
FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET UNTIL 1459Z WHEN A SUDDEN
IMPULSE OF 8 NANOTESLAS, MEASURED AT BOULDER, WAS OBSERVED.
SOURCE OF THE SHOCK WAS NOT DETERMINED. QUIET TO UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS CLOSED OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED.
