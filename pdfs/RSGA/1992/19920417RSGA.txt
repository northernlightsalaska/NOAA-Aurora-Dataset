JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 108 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. C-CLASS ACTIVITY WAS MORE
FREQUENT OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS WITH REGION 7135 (S15E66)
HAVING THE MOST FLARES. ITS LARGEST EFFORT WAS A C4/0F AT 1829Z.
REGION 7132 (S26E27) HAD A FEW FLARES AS IT CONTINUED TO GROW
IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA. ONE NEW REGION, 7136 (N19E60) WAS
NUMBERED. SIGNIFICANT SURGE AND ACTIVE PROMINENCE ACTIVITY
OCCURRED BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AT EAST LIMB, POSSIBLY HERALDING
THE RETURN OF A BAND OF PREVIOUSLY ACTIVE LONGITUDES. THESE
SOON-TO-ARRIVE ACTIVE REGIONS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TODAY'S
LARGE INCREASE IN THE 10.7 CM RADIO FLUX.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. M-CLASS FLARES ARE INCREASINGLY MORE LIKELY OVER TIME,
PENDING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONS 7132 AND 7135 AND THE
IMMINENT RETURN OF OLD ACTIVE REGIONS 7116 AND 7117.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED UNTIL 20 APRIL. A NARROW
EQUATORWARD EXTENSION OF THE SOUTHERN POLAR CROWN CORONAL HOLE
WILL BE FAVORABLY LOCATED LATE IN THE INTERVAL AND LIKELY
SPAWN A BRIEF EPISODE OF DISTURBED CONDITIONS.
