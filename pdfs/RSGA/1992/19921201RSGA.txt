IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
PREDOMINANTLY LOW. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-

CONSIDERED THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR SUCH AN EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:

QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS STARTED THE PERIOD BUT A MODEST DIS-
TURBANCE BEGAN AROUND 09Z AND KEPT THE FIELD AT ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TOMORROW AND IS EXPECTED TO BE
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS. THE
INCREASE IS EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE.
