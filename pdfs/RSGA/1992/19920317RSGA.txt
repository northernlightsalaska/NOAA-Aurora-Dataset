IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  CLASS C FLARES HAVE BEEN
OCCURRING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN SEVERAL REGIONS INCLUDING
7099 (S26W13) AND THE SPOTLESS REGION 7093 (S24W62).  THE
REGIONS CURRENTLY VISIBLE ALL APPEAR MOSTLY STABLE WITH A SLOW
TREND TOWARD SIMPLIFICATION IN 7099 AND 7100 (S15W14).  REGION
7108 (N04E65) IS FULLY VISIBLE AND CONTAINS NO MORE THAN A
H-TYPE SPOT GROUP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  FREQUENT CLASS C FLARES ARE EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE FROM ANY OF THE DISK REGIONS.  AN OCCASIONAL
M-FLARE IS POSSIBLE.  OLD REGION 7070, WHICH PRODUCED
ONE CLASS X AND FOUR CLASS M FLARES ON ITS LAST DISK
PASSAGE, IS DUE TO RETURN AT NO7 ON 18 MARCH AT
CARRINGTON LONGITUDE 024.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:

FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  A SUDDEN IMPULSE, PROBABLY ASSOCIATED
WITH THE M-7 FLARE OF 15 MARCH/0154 UT, OCCURRED AT 17/0952
UT.  THE MAGNETIC FIELD HAS TENDED TOWARD INCREASING
ACTIVITY SINCE THEN BUT K-INDICES HAVE NOT EXCEEDED 5 AT
THIS TIME.  NO INDICATION OF A STORM-MAIN-PHASE IS
YET EVIDENT.  SATELLITE MAGNETOMETERS SHOWED A STEADILY
INCREASING FIELD AT GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT FROM 17/1500
UNTIL NEARLY 2100 UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT
15 TO 24 HOURS.  AFTER THAT, A SEVERAL-DAY PERIOD OF
