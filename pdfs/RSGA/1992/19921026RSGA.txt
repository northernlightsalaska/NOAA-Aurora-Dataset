JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 300 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7321 (S24W18)
PRODUCED AN M4/2B FLARE AT 26/1816Z. MINOR DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS
ACCOMPANIED THE FLARE. THIS REGION CONTINUED TO GROW, BUT AT A
REDUCED RATE. IT REMAINED STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX RETAINING TWO
STRONG DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATIONS. REGION 7315 (NO7W74) WAS
STABLE AS IT APPROACHED THE LIMB. REGION 7323 (S13E41) DISPLAYED
MINOR GROWTH WHILE PRODUCING A FEW SUBFLARES. AN ERUPTIVE
PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED NEAR S21W90 AT 26/1445. IT REACHED A
VERTICAL EXTENT OF 0.14 SOLAR RADII. NEW REGIONS 7325 (S16E76),
7326 (S07E73), AND 7327 (N09W50) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7321 WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES
AND MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. PERIODS OF ACTIVE LEVELS WERE OBSERVED
AT SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE
FIRST TWO DAYS. ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO ACTIVE
LEVELS DURING THE LAST DAY. THESE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED IN
RESPONSE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
