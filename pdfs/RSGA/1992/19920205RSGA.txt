JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 036 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THERE WERE THREE
M-CLASS FLARES TODAY, THE FIRST WAS AN M1/1F AT 0645Z FROM
REGION 7030 (N06W81), THE SECOND WAS AN M2/1B FROM REGION
7039 (S15W28) AT 1319Z. THE THIRD WAS THE LARGEST, AN M3 AT
2032Z, AND MOST INTERESTING, BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A
SMALL FLARE IN PROGRESS IN REGION 7039, OBSERVERS BELIEVE THE
MAJORITY OF THE X-RAYS EMANATED FROM A BRIGHT POINT ON THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB NEAR THE LOCATION OF REGION 7031 (S07E89).
ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS MAY CONFIRM A LOCATION AT A LATER DATE.
NEW REGION 7048 (S04E38) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE AT MODERATE LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.
REGIONS 7039 AND 7042 (S12W01) ARE THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES
OF THIS ACTIVITY.
