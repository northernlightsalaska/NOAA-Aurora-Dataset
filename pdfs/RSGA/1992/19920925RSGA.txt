IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. NONE OF THE EIGHT
SPOTTED REGIONS FROM YESTERDAY WERE ABLE TO EXCEED C-LEVEL IN
X-RAYS OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. IN FACT A NEW, SOON-TO-APPEAR

VERY LOW TO LOW THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE NEW REGION NOW AT
THE NORTHEAST LIMB MAY PROVE WORTH WATCHING.
