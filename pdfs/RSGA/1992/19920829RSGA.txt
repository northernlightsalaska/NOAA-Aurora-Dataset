JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 242 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE MOST INTERESTING EVENT
OF THE PAST DAY WAS A LONG DURATION C1 FLARE THAT STARTED AT
28/2211Z, REACHED A MAXIMUM AT 29/0018Z, AND LASTED ABOUT SIX
HOURS. THE SOLAR SOURCE OF THIS EVENT IS UNCLEAR BUT IT MAY BE
ASSOCIATED WITH FLARE ACTIVITY IN REGION 7268 (N04W67) OR EPL
ACTIVITY AT THE EAST LIMB. NEW REGIONS 7269 (S18W42) AND
7270 (S09E65) WERE NUMBERED. REGION 7270 IS A SMALL SUNSPOT
GROUP AND NOT PARTICULARLY ACTIVE. IT IS LOCATED JUST TO THE
WEST OF OLD REGION 7248. X-RAY IMAGES SUGGEST THAT MORE SUNSPOTS
MAY ROTATE INTO VIEW AT THIS LATITUDE WITHIN THE NEXT DAY OR SO.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THE CHANCE OF MODERATE ACTIVITY WILL INCREASE AS PREVIOUSLY
ACTIVE LONGITUDES RETURN AT THE EAST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
THE FIELD GRADUALLY BECAME DISTURBED AT ABOUT 29/0100Z AND
RETURNED TO QUIET LEVELS BY 29/1800Z. THE CAUSE OF THIS
DISTURBANCE IS UNKNOWN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
