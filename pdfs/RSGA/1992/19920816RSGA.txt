JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 229 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7260 (N17E15) GREW
IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. TWO DELTA REGIONS FORMED, ONE
SOUTHEAST OF THE LARGE LEADER AND THE OTHER IN THE TRAILER.
REGION 7260 PRODUCED THE DAY'S LARGEST FLARE (C2/SF). REGION
7262 (N17W43) ALSO PRODUCED A C1/SF FLARE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7260 HAS MODERATE FLARE POTENTIAL DUE
TO THE DUEL DELTA CONFIGURATION WHICH DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. A CORONAL HOLE SHOULD
INCREASE ACTIVITY FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD. 18 AUGUST SHOULD BE THE
MOST ACTIVE DAY WHEN MINOR STORM LEVELS ARE EXPECTED FOR HIGH
LATITUDES.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPERATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
