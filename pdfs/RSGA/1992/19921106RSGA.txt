JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 311 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. MOST OF TODAY'S LOW LEVEL
FLARE ACTIVITY WAS FROM REGION 7334 (N13E60), A SMALL GROWING
DAO SPOT GROUP. TODAY'S LARGEST EVENT WAS A C1/SF FLARE AT
1055Z. REGION 7330 (S08E03) CONTINUES AS THE LARGEST GROUP ON
THE DISK AT 450 MILLIONTHS AND SHOWS MODEST MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
NEVERTHELESS THE REGION COULD ONLY MUSTER A COUPLE SUBFLARES
DURING THE PERIOD. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB (AROUND
S20) IN X-RAYS AND IN CALCIUM XV INDICATE SOME ACTIVITY MAY BE
OCCURING BEHIND THE LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW, BUT WITH A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT
SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. REGION 7330 SHOWS THE MOST
POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING AN M-CLASS EVENT. BACKGROUND LEVELS
ARE EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY INCREASE AS THE INFERRED ACTIVE REGION
BEHIND THE EAST LIMB ROTATES INTO VIEW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A
PERIOD OF ACTIVE LEVELS WITH HIGH LATITUDE MINOR STORM
LEVELS OCCURRED FROM 1200-1500Z. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV
PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN ON 30 OCTOBER ENDED TODAY AT
0010UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. IS-
OLATED ACTIVE PERIODS ARE POSSIBLE DUE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS.
