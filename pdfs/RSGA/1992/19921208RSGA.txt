JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 343 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 DEC 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  NEW REGION 7363 (S08E67)
PRODUCED A C5/SF FLARE AT 1809Z, THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE DAY.
REGION 7360 (S17E42) PRODUCED A C4/SF FLARE, AND THERE WERE
THREE UNCORRELATED C-CLASS FLARES, POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH
REGION 7361 BEHIND THE WEST LIMB. THREE NEW REGIONS WERE
NUMBERED: REGION 7363, REGION 7364 (N09E65), AND REGION 7365
(S21E12). NEW LEADER SPOTS EMERGED ASSOCIATED WITH REGION
7355 (S17W00), EXPANDING THE REGION FROM AN HAX TYPE TO A CAO.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  REGION 7363 HAS THE BEST POTENTIAL OF PRODUCING AN M-CLASS
FLARE, ALTHOUGH PRESENT PROBABILITY IS LOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS, DUE TO A TRANS-EQUATORIAL
EXTENSION OF THE SOUTHERN POLAR CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY IN THE PERIOD AND
MOSTLY UNSETTLED LATER ON, AS THE CORONAL HOLE MOVES OUT OF
FAVORABLE POSITION.
