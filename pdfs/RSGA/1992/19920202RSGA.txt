JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 033 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7042 (S12E39)
GENERATED AN M2/1N FLARE WITH WEAK TYPE II SWEEP AT 0908Z. THE
ONLY OTHER M-CLASS EVENT OF THE PERIOD WAS AN M1/0N AT 1520Z
FROM REGION 7031 (S05W49). THIS PAIR OF REGIONS DOMINATED THE
FLARE ACTIVITY DURING THE PERIOD, AS BOTH WERE LARGELY UNCHANGED
IN THEIR APPEARANCE FROM YESTERDAY. BRIGHT PLAGE AND TIGHT
MAGNETIC GRADIENTS CHARACTERIZE BOTH GROUPS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. WATCH PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED REGIONS 7031 AND 7042 FOR
ADDITIONAL M-CLASS ACTIVITY. ALSO, REGION 7039 (S15E11) MAY
HAVE M-CLASS FLARES TOO, IF AN INSTABILITY DEVELOPS THERE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS THE PAST 24
HOURS. EPISODES OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS OCCURRED AT ALL
LATITUDES. THIS DISTURBANCE, BEGINNING ABOUT 01/1500Z, IS
LIKELY DUE TO FLARE ACTIVITY OF 30 JANUARY. A RECENT SHOCK,
EVIDENCED BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 34 NANOTESLA AT BOULDER AT
02/1154Z, MAY BE PROLONGING THE INITIAL FLARE-RELATED PULSE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO VARY FROM UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS FOR THE
NEXT 72 HOURS.
