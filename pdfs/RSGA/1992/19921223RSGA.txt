JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 358 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 DEC 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7374 (S09E07)
CONTINUED ITS SLOW DECLINE AS IT SIMPLIFIED IN BOTH WHITE
LIGHT AND MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. IT GENERATED JUST TWO C-CLASS
SUBFLARES. ELSEWHERE, SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY, ANOTHER SIZEABLE
FILAMENT LOCATED NEAR CENTER DISK DISAPPEARED ABOUT 1200Z. THIS
FILAMENT WAS ORIENTED NORTH-SOUTH AND SPANNED ABOUT 15 DEGREES.
LITTLE ELSE OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS REPORTED. THE OTHER 7 SPOTTED
REGIONS VISIBLE ARE DISTINCTLY COMMONPLACE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7374 SEEMS CAPABLE OF JUST C-CLASS ACTIVITY.
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE TO OCCUR FOR AN M-CLASS
FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
24-36 HOURS. CONDITIONS SHOULD THEN BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE
DISTURBED THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD DUE TO EFFECTS OF THE
LARGE CENTER-DISK FILAMENT WHICH DISAPPEARED EARLY 22 DECEMBER.
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS ARE FORECAST TO END THE INTERVAL.
