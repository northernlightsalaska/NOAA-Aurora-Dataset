IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. NEWLY EMERGING REGION
7172 (N22E54) PRODUCED TWO C-CLASS SUBFLARES TODAY: THE LARGEST
WAS A C4 AT 1942Z. THE GROUP IS SMALL (50 MILLIONTHS) BUT EX-
HIBITS BRIGHT PLAGE AND SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. THE REMAINING
SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS WERE QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7172 IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MAIN SOURCE FOR CON-
TINUED C-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A SUDDEN IMPULSE
OCCURRED AT 2023Z. THE IMPULSE MEASURED 26 NANOTESLA IN
BOULDER. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR THE IMPULSE IS A FAVORABLY
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED WITH BRIEF ACTIVE PERIODS FOR THE
NEXT TWELVE HOURS. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN TO QUIET
TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
