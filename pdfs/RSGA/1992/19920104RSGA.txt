TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6993 (S10E18),
THOUGH SHOWING LITTLE GROWTH OR INCREASED COMPLEXITY, PRODUCED
FOUR M-CLASS FLARES. THE LARGEST WAS AN M2/1N AT 0539Z. REGION
6994 (S15E23) CONTINUED TO GROW IN SIZE, BUT REMAINED GENERALLY
QUIET. ISOLATED SUBFLARING WAS OBSERVED FROM REGION 6985
(S20W90). REGION 6988 (S14W70) GENERATED THE LARGEST EVENT OF
THE PERIOD: AN M4/1N FLARE AT 1846Z. A 290 FLUX UNIT TENFLARE
BURST ACCOMPANIED THIS ACTIVITY. AN UNCORRELATED LONG DURATION
M1 X-RAY EVENT WAS OBSERVED AT 1129Z. NEW REGIONS 6998 (N03E57),
6999 (N21E66), AND 7000 (N13W27) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. CONTINUED M-CLASS FLARING IS POSSIBLE FROM
REGIONS 6985, 6988, 6993, AND 6994.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A
SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON ENHANCEMENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV
BEGAN NEAR 04/0300Z AND CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. A
TENTATIVE PEAK OF 1.6 PFU WAS NOTED AT 1240Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. THE PROTON ENHANCEMENT SHOULD
DECLINE TO BACKGROUND LEVELS WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
