IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. AN UNCORRELATED C7 X-RAY

POTENTIAL FOR C-CLASS FLARES AND AN OUTSIDE CHANCE FOR AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED

STORM LEVELS. THE GOES 6 SATELLITE EXPERIENCED A SHORT-LIVED
MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSING AT ABOUT 17/1730UT. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF
19 NANOTESLAS WAS OBSERVED IN MID-LATITUDES AT ABOUT 17/0615UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE ENTIRE
FORECAST PERIOD BECAUSE OF A WELL POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS MAY CONTINUE TO SEE MINOR STORM LEVELS.
