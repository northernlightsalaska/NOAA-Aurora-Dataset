JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 230 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7260 (N15E03)
PRODUCED SEVERAL LOW LEVEL FLARES, THE LARGEST A C3/1B AT 1845Z.
REGIONS 7262 (N17W57) AND 7264 (N15E46) PRODUCED MOST OF THE
OTHER B- AND C-CLASS FLARES TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 7260 CONTINUES TO GROW AND HAS
DEVELOPED A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. REGION 7264
HAS ALSO GROWN AND SHOWS INCREASING FLARE POTENTIAL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS EARLY IN THE
PERIOD AND MOSTLY UNSETTLED LATER IN THE PERIOD, DUE TO A
CORONAL HOLE WHICH PRODUCED ACTIVE DAYS DURING THE LAST TWO
SOLAR ROTATIONS.
