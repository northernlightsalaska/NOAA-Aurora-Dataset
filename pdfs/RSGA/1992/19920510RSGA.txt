PRODUCED TWO ISOLATED SUBFLARES. REGION 7154 (S25W25) DECLINED
SLIGHTLY IN SIZE AND SPOT COUNT. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE REACHING
0.08 SOLAR RADII OCCURRED AT 10/0910Z NEAR N23E89. A 25 DEGREE
FILAMENT LOCATED NEAR S08E50 DISAPPEARED SOMETIME AFTER

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS. THE SEVERE STORMING OCCURRED FROM 10/0900-1800Z. THIS
DISTURBANCE WAS PROBABLY IN RESPONSE TO THE LONG DURATION
C3/2F FLARE OF 07/0715Z. THE M7/4B FLARE OF 08/1546Z PROBABLY
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DISTURBANCE AS WELL. THE M7/4B FLARE ALSO
CAUSED THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT THAT BEGAN AT
09/1005Z AND REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 4600 PFU AT 09/2100Z. THE
GREATER THAN 10 MEV FLUX WAS AT ABOUT 20 PFU AND GRADUALLY
DECREASING AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE POLAR CAP ABSORPTION
EVENT WHICH BEGAN AT 09/1405Z REACHED AN ESTIMATED MAXIMUM OF
20.4 DB AT 09/2100Z AND GRADUALLY DECLINED THEREAFTER.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE FIRST
HALF OF DAY ONE, GRADUALLY DECLINING TO MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS
THROUGH THE SECOND DAY. THE FINAL DAY IS EXPECTED TO AT MOSTLY
UNSETTLED LEVELS. THE PROTON AND POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENTS
ARE EXPECTED TO END DURING THE FIRST DAY OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.
