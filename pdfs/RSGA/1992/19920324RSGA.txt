JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 084 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 MAR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED AT A LOW LEVEL. REGIONS
7116 (S10E52) AND NEARBY 7117 (N07E55) HAD THE BRUNT OF THE
DAY'S FLARES, BUT NONE EXCEEDED THE MID C-LEVEL. REGION 7117 IS
THE BRIGHTEST AND LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK, BUT SEEMS TO BE
RELATIVELY SIMPLE IN ITS MAGNETIC TOPOLOGY. THE OTHER SIX SPOT
GROUPS WERE GENERALLY QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THERE IS AN INCREASING CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
EVENT FROM REGION 7117.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOME
SUBSTORMS OCCURRED DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIMES. THIS MINOR
DISTURBANCE IS THOUGHT TO BE DUE TO A WELL-LOCATED CORONAL
HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT UNSETTLED TO MILDLY ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
ANOTHER 24 HOURS. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO END THE
INTERVAL. PERIODIC SUBSTORM ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE.
