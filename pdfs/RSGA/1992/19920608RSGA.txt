JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 160 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 JUN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7186 (N09W14)
GENERATED ITS SECOND M-CLASS FLARE IN TWO DAYS. THE M1/1B
PARALLEL RIBBON FLARE - MAX AT 0849Z - WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BOTH
TYPES II AND IV SWEEP. THE DURATION OF THE TYPE IV WAS OVER 3
HOURS. THE REGION IS LARGELY UNCHANGED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS,
AND STILL HAS AN ACTIVE INVERSION LINE FILAMENT. REGION 7192
(N09E33) PRODUCED A FEW SUBFLARES, MOST ORIGINATING NE OF THE
LEADER SPOTS. LITTLE ELSE OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS REPORTED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS ANTICIPATED
FROM REGION 7186 DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
THE PAST 24 HOURS. THIS DISTURBANCE, LACKING A WELL-DEFINED
SOLAR SOURCE, IS LIKELY DUE MORE TO THE SOUTHWARD TURNING OF
THE IMF RATHER THAN A DISTINCT CME.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT
THREE DAYS. SOME RESPONSE TO TODAY'S M1/1B WITH LENGTHY TYPE
IV MAY OCCUR NEAR THE LATTER PART OF THE INTERVAL.
