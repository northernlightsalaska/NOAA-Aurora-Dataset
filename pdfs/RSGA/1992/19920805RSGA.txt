JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 218 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 AUG 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7248 (S12E28)
AND NEARBY REGION 7251 (S18E26) COMBINED FOR MOST OF TODAY'S
ACTIVITY. THE LARGEST FLARE WAS A C2/SN FROM 7251 AT 1501Z.
THIS COMPLEX REMAINS MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX AND APPEARS CAPABLE
OF MODERATE ACTIVITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7248 HAS SHOWN SOME GROWTH OVERNIGHT
AND STILL SEEMS CAPABLE OF AT LEAST MODERATE ACTIVITY. X-RAY
IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THERE IS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN REGIONS
7248 AND 7251 WHICH MAY PROVE FLARE PRODUCTIVE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR
STORM LEVELS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 17 NANOTESLA WAS RECORDED
AT BOULDER AT 0024Z. MINOR STORM LEVELS FOLLOWED AND CONTINUED
UNTIL ABOUT 1200Z. A DISAPPEARING FILAMENT FROM THE NORTHEAST
QUADRANT ON 01 AUGUST IS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THIS
DISTURBANCE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED TO BEGIN THE PERIOD. BY DAY
THREE EFFECTS FROM A RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE ARE POSSIBLE AND
CONDITIONS MAY INCREASE TO ACTIVE LEVELS.
