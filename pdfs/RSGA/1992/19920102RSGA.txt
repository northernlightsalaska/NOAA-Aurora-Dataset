SDF NUMBER 002 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 JAN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6994 (S15E49)
PRODUCED AN M1/SF FLARE AT 02/1224Z. THIS AREA CONTINUED TO GROW
IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY THROUGH THE PERIOD. REGION 6993 (S09E43),
STACKED TO THE NORTH OF 6994, ALSO SHOWED SOME GROWTH WHILE
GENERATING ISOLATED C-CLASS FLARES. REGIONS 6985 (S17W66) AND
6988 (S15W48) EACH PRODUCED OCCASIONAL C-CLASS EVENTS. SPOT
GROWTH WAS NOTED IN THE TRAILING PORTION OF 6985 WHERE SOME OF
THE FLARING HAS BEEN NOTED. TWO 10 DEGREE SEGMENTS OF FILAMENT,
ONE LOCATED NEAR S18E10, THE OTHER NEAR S25W35, DISAPPEARED
DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. NEW REGION 6966 (N08E76) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY MODERATE. REGIONS 6985, 6988, AND THE 6993/6994
COMPLEX MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE FIRST TWO DAYS IN
RESPONSE TO A CORONAL HOLE AND POSSIBLE EFFECTS FROM MAJOR
FLARING NOTED ON THE 1ST.
