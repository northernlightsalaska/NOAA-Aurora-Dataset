JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 334 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7351 (S15W05),
A SIMPLE BXO SPOT GROUP, PRODUCED AN M1/1N FLARE AT 1234Z. THE
REGION HAS SINCE SIMPLIFIED TO A SPOTLESS PLAGE. PERHAPS A MORE
INTERESTING EVENT PRECEDED THE M1 FLARE, THAT A LONG-DURATION
C9 WITH TYPE II AT 0858Z. THE SOURCE OF THIS EVENT IS THOUGHT TO
BE REGION 7345 (S25W89) WHERE POST-FLARE LOOPS WERE SEEN SHORTLY
AFTER THE X-RAY MAXIMUM. THIS FLARE IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF AN
ENHANCEMENT IN THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUXES WHICH
STARTED TWO HOURS LATER.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7348 (N12W16), STILL THE MOST IMPRESSIVE REGION IN
WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA, COULD SUMMON AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE
IF AN INSTABILITY SHOULD DEVELOP THERE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS. AN ENHANCEMENT IN THE GREATER THAN 10
MEV PROTON FLUXES BEGAN JUST BEFORE 1100Z AND REACHED A
MAXIMUM OF 8 PFU AT 1520Z. FLUXES ARE SLOWLY DECLINING NOW.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
