JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 342 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 DEC 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE
PERIOD WAS AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED C6 AT 07/1434Z. REGION 7361
(S14W85) CONTINUED TO EMERGE AND PRODUCED FREQUENT SUBFLARES.
THE FIRST YOHKOH IMAGE RECEIVED SINCE 04 DEC REVEALED TWO
REGIONS AT APPROXIMATELY N10E90 AND S09E90. THE
NORTHERN REGION IS MORE EXTENSIVE AND IS THE LIKELY
SOURCE OF THE C6 FLARE ABOVE AND THE LONG DURATION C2 FLARE
NOTED ON 06 DEC. HOWEVER, NEITHER REGION IS INTENSE IN
X-RAYS OR AT 10CM.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
GENERALLY LOW. THE NEW REGIONS AT THE EAST LIMB AND REGION
7361 COULD PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE BUT LIMB
PROXIMITY PREVENTS ACCURATE ASSESSMENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET UNTIL NEAR 07/0900Z
WHEN UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS BEGAN. HIGH LATITUDE
STATIONS EXPERIENCED MAJOR STORMING BETWEEN 07/1300-1500Z.
FOLLOWING THIS DISTURBANCE, THE FIELD RETURNED TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS. THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURBANCE IS MOST LIKELY THE
TRANSEQUATORIAL LOBE OF THE SOUTHERN POLAR CORONAL HOLE NOW
ABOUT 3 DAYS PAST CENTRAL MERIDIAN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD CONTINUE AT GENERALLY ACTIVE LEVELS FOR 08-09 DEC.
MINOR, TO BRIEF MAJOR, STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES ARE
POSSIBLE DURING THIS INTERVAL. PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS SHOULD OCCUR ON 10 DEC AS THE CORONAL HOLE
RELATED HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND STREAM LEAVES THE VICINITY OF
THE EARTH.
