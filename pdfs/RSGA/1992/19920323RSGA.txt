JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 083 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 MAR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ALTHOUGH FEW FLARES
OCCURRED, TWO NEW REGIONS WITH BRIGHT PLAGE ROTATED INTO VIEW.
NEWLY ASSIGNED REGIONS 7116 (S09E65) AND 7117 (N07E66) HAD
NEARLY ALL OF THE REPORTED FLARES, AND 7117, IN PARTICULAR,
SEEMS TO BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR MORE FLARES. TWO OTHER NEW
REGIONS WERE BORN ON THE DISK, REGION 7114 (S07E18) AND 7115
(N05E13).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. IF CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OCCURS IN EITHER REGION 7116 OR
7117, AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE MAY FOLLOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY ACTIVE. SUBSTORMS OCCURRED
IN NIGHTTIME SECTORS. THE EXPECTED DISTURBANCE SPAWNED BY A
WELL-POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE MAY HAVE BEGUN JUST AFTER 1800Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
48 HOURS. ACTIVITY SHOULD BE MOST INTENSE DURING NIGHTTIME
HOURS.
