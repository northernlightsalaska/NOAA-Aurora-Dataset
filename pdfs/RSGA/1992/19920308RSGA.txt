SDF NUMBER 068 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 MAR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7091 (S09E43)
PRODUCED AN M4/2N FLARE AT 08/1739Z. THIS FLARE WAS LONG
DURATION IN X-RAYS AND WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH TYPE II/IV SWEEP
ACTIVITY AND A 200 SFU RADIO BURST AT 2695 MHZ. THIS REGION
APPEARS TO BE GROWING IN SUNSPOT AREA AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IN ADDITION TO THE M FLARE, IT PRODUCED C-CLASS ACTIVITY AND
FREQUENT FLARE BRIGHT FLUCTUATIONS DURING THE PAST DAY. REGION
7093 (S24E53) ALSO PRODUCED M-CLASS ACTIVITY, AN M1/SF AT

ITS SUNSPOT AREA BY ABOUT SEVEN FOLD SINCE YESTERDAY. NEW REGION
7097 (S32E03) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY MAY OCCUR IN
REGIONS 7091 AND 7093.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR MOST OF THE
PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS OCCURRED AT MANY STATIONS FROM
08/1200-1800Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE DUE TO A CORONAL HOLE.
A MINOR SATELLITE PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV IS
POSSIBLE AS A RESULT OF THE M4/2N FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE.
THIS EVENT IS FORECAST TO BEGIN AT ABOUT 09/0600Z.
