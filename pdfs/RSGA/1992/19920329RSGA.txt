IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY LOW LEVEL C-CLASS
FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD. MOST OF THESE WERE FROM
REGION 7120 (S19E08) WHICH CONTINUES TO GROW AND DEVELOP.
REGION 7117 (N07W11) ALSO GREW DURING THE DAY (AREA IS AT 1250
MILLIONTHS) AND PRODUCED A COUPLE OF SMALL FLARES. THE REGION
SHOWS AREAS OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS, BUT ITS STRUCTURE
REMAINS FAIRLY SIMPLE AND IT CONTINUES TO BE STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 7117 AND 7120 ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
TO PRODUCE C-CLASS FLARES. THERE IS A POSSIBILTY FOR MODERATE
LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, DEPENDING ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF
REGION 7117.
