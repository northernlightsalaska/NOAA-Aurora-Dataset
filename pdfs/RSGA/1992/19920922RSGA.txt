JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 266 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 SEP 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. ALL REGIONS ON THE
DISK WERE STABLE. REGION 7288 GREW TO 150 MILLIONTHS WITH NO
FLARE ACTIVITY. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED: 7291 (S06E14)
AND  7292 (N18E76).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
BEGIN THE PERIOD AT VERY LOW LEVELS. THE NEXT TWO DAYS SHOULD BE
AT LOW ACTIVITY LEVELS DUE TO THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 7270
(S10, L-038) WHICH PRODUCED 20 M-FLARES AND 2 X-FLARES LAST
ROTATION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. SOME
STATIONS EXPERIENCED MINOR STORM LEVELS FROM 0100-0600Z
WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO SUBSTORMING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. RECURRENCE AND X-RAY IMAGERY
SUGGEST A SMALL CORONAL HOLE AT 45 WEST LONGITUDE.
