TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7117 (N07E42)
CONTINUED ITS RAPID GROWTH, MORE THAN DOUBLING IN SIZE TO MORE
THAN 600 MILLIONTHS. AS IT GREW IT PRODUCED FREQUENT C-CLASS
FLARES. THE LARGEST EVENTS WERE A C7/0B AT 1730Z, AND THEN A
C7/0N AT 1850Z. NEARBY REGION 7116 (S09E40) HAD OCCASIONAL

MODERATE. REGION 7117 HAS ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A REGION
CAPABLE OF M-CLASS ACTIVITY, AND, IF IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE,
WILL PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT FLARES IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO ACTIVE, WITH THE MOST
DISTURBED TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH NIGHTTIME SUBSTORMS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. NIGHTTIME SUBSTORMS ARE
