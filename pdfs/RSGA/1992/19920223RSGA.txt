SDF NUMBER 054 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. AN UNCORRELATED C6 X-RAY
EVENT WAS OBSERVED AT 22/2119Z. NO FLARING WAS REPORTED WITH
THIS ACTIVITY HOWEVER A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM WAS OBSERVED
AFTERWARDS IN REGION 7074 (N16E59). ISOLATED SUBFLARING WAS
OBSERVED IN REGIONS 7069 (S04E29), 7070 (N07E43), AND 7073
(S15W63). SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND INCREASED MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY
WAS NOTED IN REGIONS 7070 AND 7067 (N05E15). AN EVENT LEVEL
BRIGHT SURGE WAS OBSERVED ON THE EAST LIMB NEAR S21 AT 1516Z.
A MAJOR TYPE II SWEEP ACCOMPANIED THIS ACTIVITY WHICH MAY BE
ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNING OLD REGION 7039 (S14, L-330), A SPOT
AREA WHICH PRODUCED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FLARES DURING ITS LAST
ROTATION.  NEW REGION 7076 (N10E70) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARING REMAINS POSSIBLE FROM REGION
7067 OR 7070. RETURNING OLD REGION 7039 MAY ADD TO ACTIVITY
LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED UNTIL THE 25TH WHEN ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE IN RESPONSE TO THE
LARGE FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE NOTED ON THE 22ND.
