JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 299 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 25 OCT 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES
OCCURRED. THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS A C3/SF FROM NEW REGION 7323
(S14E53) WHICH GREW AT A GRADUAL PACE. THE MOST ACTIVE REGION
WAS 7321 (S23W04). IT PRODUCED SEVERAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES WHILE
DISPLAYING A 500 PERCENT INCREASE IN AREA. IT ALSO BECAME
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX IN MAGNETIC STRUCTURE DEVELOPING TWO
MAGNETIC DELTA CONFIGURATIONS. REGION 7315 (N06W65) DISPLAYED
MINOR GROWTH AND PRODUCED A FEW SUBFLARES EARLY IN THE PERIOD.
REGION 7316 (S12W26) SHOWED MINOR DECAY. NEW REGIONS 7322
(N01W06) AND 7324 (N16E74) WERE ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7321 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES. IT
MAY ALSO PRODUCE A MAJOR FLARE IF ITS PRESENT RATE OF GROWTH
CONTINUES. REGION 7316 MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS DURING THE FIRST
DAY. ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD DUE TO CORONAL HOLE
EFFECTS.
