JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 309 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 NOV 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES
WERE THE ORDER OF THE DAY. PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING OCCUR-
RENCE OF THE PERIOD WAS THE RAPID EMERGENCE OF NEWLY NUMBERED
REGION 7332 (S21W27). JUST A SINGLE SPOT 24 HOURS AGO, IT HAS
GROWN TO BE 130 MILLIONTHS WITH MORE THAN 10 SPOTS NOW. IT WAS
THE SITE OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE DAY'S FLARES. ELSEWHERE, A
MODEST EPL WAS REPORTED NEAR N28 EAST LIMB ABOUT 1500Z, AND ONE
OTHER NEW REGION, 7333 (N07E47) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. WATCH REGION 7332 AND REGION 7330 (S08E31), A
GROWING REGION WITH BRIGHT PLAGE, FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD VARIED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS,
A PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE PAST FEW DAYS. HOWEVER, THE
MOST DISTURBED INTERVALS TODAY WERE DURING LOCAL DAYLIGHT
HOURS. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT IS STILL IN
PROGRESS. THE VALUE AT 2100Z WAS JUST ABOVE EVENT THRESHOLD,
MEASURING 15 PFU.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
