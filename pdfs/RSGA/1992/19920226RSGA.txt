JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 057 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7073, NOW
ALMOST A DAY PAST WEST LIMB NEAR S16, HAD THE ONE M-CLASS FLARE
OF THE INTERVAL, AN IMPULSIVE M1/0N AT 0139Z. SURGING HAS
BEEN REPORTED IN THAT AREA SINCE. LITTLE ELSE OF SIGNIFICANCE
HAS OCCURRED ON THE DISK TODAY, AS MOST REGIONS HAVE BEEN
STABLE OR SLOWLY DECAYING. ONE NEW REGION WAS ASSIGNED, 7080
(N20W11).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE MODERATE. ALTHOUGH UNPRODUCTIVE LATELY, REGIONS
7067 (N05W26) AND 7070 (N07E01) ARE LIKELY SOURCES FOR
ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD FLUCTUATED BETWEEN UNSETTLED AND MAJOR
STORM LEVELS THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 20 NANO-
TESLA (AT BOULDER) OCCURRED AT 1657Z, HERALDING THE ONSET OF
MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS AT ALL LATITUDES. THE GOES 6
AND 7 SPACECRAFT EXPERIENCED MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSINGS, LASTING
MORE THAN THREE HOURS, JUST AFTER 1700Z. THIS DISTURBANCE IS
PROBABLY DUE TO THE QUICK ARRIVAL OF A SHOCK FROM THE M4/2B
FLARE OF 24/2335Z. ANOTHER EFFECT OF THIS FLARE IS AN ORDER
OF MAGNITUDE INCREASE IN THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUX
WHICH BEGAN EARLY ON THE 26TH. THE PEAK FLUX SO FAR IS ABOUT
1 PFU.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT 24 TO
36 HOURS. THE DISTURBANCE SHOULD GRADUALLY WEAKEN, WITH
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS IN PLACE BY 29 FEBRUARY. THE CURRENT
PROTON ENHANCEMENT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO DECLINE THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD.
