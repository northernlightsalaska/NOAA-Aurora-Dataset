JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 141 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 MAY 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY LOW LEVEL C-CLASS
EVENTS OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD: MOST OF THESE WERE NOT OB-
SERVED OPTICALLY DUE TO LIMITED OBSERVATIONS. REGION 7172
(N23E27) DOMINATES THE DISK IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY AND SHOWED
STEADY GROWTH DURING THE DAY: THE REGION APPEARS TO BE
STABILIZING FROM ITS EARLY GROWTH PHASE AS THE FREQUENCY OF
FLARES AND INTENSITY OF PLAGE HAVE BEEN REDUCED. NEW REGION
7174 (N14E69) ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY AS A SMALL D-TYPE BUT
WAS STABLE AND QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW WITH A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT. REGION
7172 IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MAIN SOURCE FOR FLARES OVER THE
NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED WITH PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS FOR
THE NEXT TWO DAYS AS A RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE OR THE DISAPPEARING FILAMENT NOTED IN YESTERDAY'S
FORECAST. CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED
SOMETIME LATE ON THE SECOND DAY AND LASTING THROUGH THE THIRD
DAY.
