LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7248 COULD PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A BRIEF PERIOD OF ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM LEVELS OCCURRED NEAR 09/1000Z AND MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO
CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPECIAL MESSAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1992 SESC WILL BE INCLUDING A NEW
PROBABILITY FORECAST FOR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN ITS
DAILY FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A NEW SECTION VI SPECIFYING
THE PROBABILITY FOR ACTIVE, MINOR STORM, AND MAJOR/SEVERE
STORM LEVELS (SEPERATELY FOR MIDDLE AND FOR HIGH LATITUDES).
AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
VI. GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY PROBABILITIES 15 JUN - 17 JUN
    A. MIDDLE LATITUDES
        ACTIVE                       35/20/20
