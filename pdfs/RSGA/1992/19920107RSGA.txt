JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 007 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 JAN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6994 (S16W17)
PRODUCED THE TWO M-CLASS EVENTS OF THE INTERVAL, AN M1/0N AT
0415Z AND AN M1/0F AT 1457Z. THE REGION IS STILL COMPLEX
MAGNETICALLY AND CONTINUES TO EVOLVE IN WHITE LIGHT. NEARBY
REGION 6993 (S10W22) HAD FEW FLARES AS IT SLOWLY DECAYED. NEW
EMERGING REGIONS CAUSED THE 10.7 CM RADIO FLUX TO INCREASE FROM
YESTERDAY AS SIX NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED. THE NEW ARRIVALS
ARE REGIONS 7002 (N08W51), 7003 (N16E26), 7004 (S16E09), 7005
(N21E11), 7006 (N10E19), AND 7007 (S05E81). REGION 7003 SEEMS
TO BE THE BRIGHTEST OF THE LOT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AT MODERATE LEVELS. REGION 6994, STILL THE PREMIER
ACTIVE CENTER, SHOULD GENERATE OCCASIONAL M-CLASS FLARES.
REGIONS 6993 AND NEWLY ASSIGNED 7003, THOUGH LESS CAPABLE,
MAY MUSTER AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO MILDLY UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
