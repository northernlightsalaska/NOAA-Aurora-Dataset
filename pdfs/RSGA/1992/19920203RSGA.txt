JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 034 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 FEB 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7042 (S12E25)
HAD FOUR M-CLASS FLARES THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE EVENTS WERE AN
M1/1N AT 02/2250Z, AN M1/0N AT 0053Z, AN M1/0N AT 0701Z, AND AN
M1/0F AT 1026Z. SMALL RADIO BURSTS WERE RECORDED WITH THREE OF
THE FOUR FLARES. THE REGION ALSO PRODUCED NUMEROUS LESSER-SIZED
FLARES AS IT GREW TO OVER 900 MILLIONTHS IN WHITE LIGHT AREA AND
RETAINED A GOOD DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. REGION 7031
(S04W65), ACTIVE THE PAST FEW DAYS, COULD MUSTER BUT C-LEVEL
FLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE MODERATE. MORE M-CLASS FLARES ARE ANTICIPATED FROM
REGION 7042, AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, FROM REGION 7031.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS THE PAST 24 HOURS. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE
DISTURBANCE WHICH BEGAN AROUND 1500Z ON 01 FEBRUARY, AND
STRENGTHENED YESTERDAY. STRONG SUBSTORMS OCCURRED IN NIGHT-
TIME SECTORS. FLARE ACTIVITY ON 30 JANUARY IS THOUGHT TO HAVE
SPAWNED THIS MAGNETIC STORM.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT 24 HOURS, WITH
THE MOST DISTURBED INTERVALS OCCURRING DURING LOCAL NIGHT-
TIMES. THE STORM SHOULD WEAKEN WITH TIME AND GIVE WAY TO
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS BY 06 FEBRUARY.
