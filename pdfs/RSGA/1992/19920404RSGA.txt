JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 095 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 APR 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. FREQUENT SMALL FLARES
WERE OBSERVED SINCE YESTERDAY FROM REGIONS 7123 (S06E41) AND
7124 (N14W47). REGION 7123 IS THE LARGEST AND MOST ACTIVE OF
THE TWO. SUNSPOT DEVELOPMENT IS APPARENT IN THE TRAILER PORTION
OF THIS GROUP AND THE MAGNETIC STRUCTURE HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY
MORE COMPLEX SINCE YESTERDAY. GROWTH IN REGION 7124 APPEARS TO
BE PEAKING. PLAGE IS LESS EXTENSIVE AND LESS BRIGHT THAN
YESTERDAY. MAGNETICALLY, THIS REGION APPEARS TO BE A SIMPLE,
BIPOLAR GROUP. A NINE DEGREE SEGMENT OF FILAMENT NEAR N23W70
DISAPPEARED FROM 04/1905-1930Z. THIS FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE
WAS SHORTLY FOLLOWED BY THE SLOW ERUPTION OF AN ACTIVE
PROMINANCE NEAR NW37. THESE EVENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A
SLOW RISE IN X-RAYS PEAKING AT C2 AT 04/1927Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED IN REGION 7123 AND ARE POSSIBLE
IN REGION 7124. AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE IS POSSIBLE IN 7123.
THERE IS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF AN M-FLARE IN 7124.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO ACTIVE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.
