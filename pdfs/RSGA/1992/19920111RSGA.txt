JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 011 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 JAN 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7004 (S14W44) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY X-RAY EVENT: A C3/SF AT 0426Z. THIS GROUP
SHOWED SOME GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD. NEW REGION 7008 (S05E74)
ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY AS A SMALL D-TYPE GROUP AND SHOWED FAIR-
LY BRIGHT PLAGE BUT COULD ONLY PRODUCE ONE SUBFLARE. REGION 6994
(S16W71) CONTINUES AS THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK BUT WAS
QUIET AND SHOWED STEADY DECAY. REGION 7007 (S04E28) IS ALSO A
FAIRLY LARGE MATURE GROUP BUT WAS STABLE DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR ISOLATED M-CLASS
EVENTS FROM EITHER OF 6994 AND 7007 GIVEN THEIR STATE OF
DEVELOPMENT. REGION 7004 MIGHT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY
AS IT CONTINUES TO GROW. AN OVERALL DOWNWARD TREND IN AC-
TIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS IS EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS AS REGIONS 6994 AND 6993 ROTATE ACROSS WEST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
AN INITIALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED FIELD ATTAINED ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM LEVELS AROUND 1030Z AND STAYED THERE FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE PERIOD. THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE INCREASE WAS
THE M5 FLARE OF 09 JANUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. SOME
MINOR STORM PERIODS MAY BE EXPECTED AT HIGH LATITUDES ON THE
FIRST DAY. THE FORECAST IS BASED ON AN EXPECTATION OF PERSIST-
ANCE OF CURRENT ACTIVITY AND ON THE BEGINNING OF EFFECTS FROM
A CORONAL HOLE WHICH IS ROTATING INTO A FAVORABLE POSITION FOR
GEOMAGNETIC EFFECTS.
