JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 193 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 JUL 1992
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. A NUMBER OF C-CLASS
FLARES WERE OBSERVED SINCE YESTERDAY, MOSTLY FROM REGIONS 7220
(S12W01) AND 7222 (S11E12). THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS A C7/SF AT
10/2354Z IN REGION 7222. REGION 7220 APPEARS TO BE SHOWING
SIGNS OF DECAY ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS LARGE AND COMPLEX. REGION
7222 HAS GROWN SOMEWHAT. REGION 7216 (N16W82) ALSO PRODUCED A
FEW SUBFLARES SINCE YESTERDAY. THE LARGEST WAS A C6/SF AT 11/
0430Z. NEW REGION 7227 (N12E68) WAS NUMBERED. THIS REGION IS
SMALL AND IS LOCATED WITHIN PLAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEADER
PORTION OF OLD REGION 7205. ADDITIONAL SPOTS ASSOCIATED WITH
THIS OLD REGION MAY ROTATE INTO VIEW OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS PROBABLE FROM THE 7220/7222
COMPLEX. A MAJOR FLARE IS ALSO POSSIBLE. X-RAY IMAGES SUGGEST
THAT MORE OF OLD 7205 WILL ROTATE INTO VIEW TOMORROW. THIS AREA
IS NOT AS ACTIVE AS WHEN IT ROTATED AROUND THE WEST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET FOR THE NEXT DAY BECOMING QUIET
TO UNSETTLED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. A
CORONAL HOLE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY LEVELS ON THE SECOND
AND THIRD DAYS.
