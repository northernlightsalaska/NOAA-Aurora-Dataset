SMALL A-TYPE GROUP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. M-CLASS FLARING IS EXPECTED FROM REGION 5495. THIS
REGION ALSO APPEARS CAPABLE OF ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS.
A BRIEF PERIOD OF ACTIVE LEVELS OCCURRED NEAR MIDDAY AT HIGH
LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWED BY TWO
DAYS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED
DUE TO THE LONG-DURATION/TYPE II SWEEP EVENT OF 20/0929Z. THE
RECURRENT PATTERN ALSO INDICATES DISTURBED CONDITIONS DURING
THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE PERIOD.
