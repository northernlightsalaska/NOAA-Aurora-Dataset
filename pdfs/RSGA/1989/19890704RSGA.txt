IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5575 (N24E39)
PRODUCED A MAJOR FLARE DURING THE PERIOD: AN M7/1B AT 0002Z
WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. THE
REGION PRODUCED ADDITIONAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES. REGION 5576
(N09E44) ALSO EXHIBITED OCCASIONAL SUBFLARE FLUCTUATIONS
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. SURGE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED ON THE WEST
LIMB AT N03 (ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXIT OF 5558), S21 (EXITING
5561 AND 5563). THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK AND LIMBS WERE
QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 5575 POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE AS IT CONTINUES TO GROW. THE RETURN OF
OLD REGIONS 5528 (N20, L-092) AND 5533 (S19, L-071) MAY ALSO
ENHANCE ACTIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS AS THEY ROTATE BACK ONTO
THE VISIBLE DISK DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET. THE FORECAST
DISTURBANCE HAS NOT YET MATERIALIZED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS TOMORROW,
BUT WITH DECREASING CONFIDENCE AS THE CHANCES FOR ARRIVAL
OF A HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND STREAM ARE DIMINISHING. CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE SECOND AND
THIRD DAYS.
