SDF NUMBER 354
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 20 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M2/2B PARALLEL
RIBBON FLARE WAS OBSERVED IN REGION 5846 (N19E13) AT 20/1911Z.
THIS REGION HAD BEEN QUIET ALL PERIOD WITH A SLOWLY DECAYING
SIMPLE SPOT CONFIGURATION NOTED. REGION 5837 (N20W05) HAS
SHOWN SUBTLE GROWTH IN ITS LEADER SPOT PENUMBRAL COVERAGE AND
MAINTAINS ITS WEAK BETA-GAMMA MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. MOSTLY
SUBFLARES AND LOW LEVEL C-CLASS ACTIVITY HAVE BEEN NOTED HERE.
REGIONS 5844 (S10W80) AND 5847 (N33W81) HAVE PRODUCED
OCCASIONAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. REGION
5836 (N13W26) REMAINED GENERALLY STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE WITH MOSTLY C-CLASS ACTIVITY EXPECTED.
ISOLATED M-LEVEL EVENTS REMAIN POSSIBLE WITH REGIONS 5837 AND
5836 APPEARING TO HAVE THE BEST POTENTIAL ALTHOUGH THE
PREVIOUS M-CLASS ACTIVITY HAS BEEN VARY RANDOM. REGION
5849 (S09E62) SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY LEVELS AS IT
CONTINUES TO MATURE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS.
