5837 (N20W17) HAS SIMPLIFIED MAGNETICALLY BUT CONTINUES TO
PRODUCE OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES. REGION 5846 (N18W00) HAS
SHOWN MINOR GROWTH IN ITS LEADER SPOT STRUCTURE AND HAS

FILAMENT SYSTEM IN ITS LEADING PORTION. REGION 5849 (S09E50)
CONTINUED TO MATURE IN SPOT STRUCTURE AND PRODUCED AN
ISOLATED SUBFLARE. REGION 5850 (S30W05) WAS ADDED TODAY.

LOW TO MODERATE WITH C-LEVEL ACTIVITY POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS
5837, 5846, AND 5849. M-CLASS EVENTS FROM ANY OF THESE REGIONS
