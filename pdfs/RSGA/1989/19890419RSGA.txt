SDF NUMBER 109
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 19 APR 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S ACTIVITY CONSISTED
OF OCCASIONAL SMALL C-CLASS SUBFLARES FROM A VARIETY OF REGIONS.
THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE DAY WAS A C7 AT 18/2110Z WHICH WAS NOT
OBSERVED OPTICALLY. NEW REGION 5456 (N32E66) ROTATED INTO VIEW
DURING THE PERIOD AND NEW REGION 5457 (N28W38) EMERGED. SURGE
ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED ON THE EAST LIMB AT N20 AND AT S20. THE
REMAINDER OF THE DISK AND LIMBS WERE STABLE OR DECLINING.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT,
PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMBINED PROBABILITIES FOR FLARES FROM
REGIONS 5449 (S21W47), 5451 (N10W16), 5452 (S17E29), AND 5453
(N19E30).

IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED TOMORROW BECOMING UNSETTLED
TO ACTIVE ON THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS. THE INCREASE IS FORE-
CAST BECAUSE OF THE CORONAL MASS EJECTION OBSERVED YESTERDAY
AND BECAUSE OF RECURRENT PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY.
