SDF NUMBER 180
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 29 JUN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGIONS 5563 (S16W20) AND
5569 (N19W13) STILL SHOW SUFFICIENT COMPLEXITY TO PRODUCE LARGE
ENERGETIC FLARES, ESPECIALLY 5569 WITH ITS DELTA CONFIGURATION.
THOUGH REGION 5555 (N27W47) HAS SIMPLIFIED THIS SPOT GROUP MAY
GENERATE SOME ENERGETIC FLARES BEFORE IT TRANSITS THE DISK. TWO
NEW REGIONS NUMBERED TODAY: 5571 (N20E24) AND 5572 (S14E76).
5572 HAS DISPLAYED ACTIVE SURGING THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND LOOKS
TO BE RETURNING OLD REGION 5521. ACTIVE SURGING HAS ALSO BEEN
OBSERVED  FROM NE13-20 WHICH MAY BE ANNOUNCING THE ARRIVAL OF
OLD REGIONS 5526 AND 5531.

MODERATE. REGIONS 5555, 5563 AND 5569 SHOULD PRODUCE THE
