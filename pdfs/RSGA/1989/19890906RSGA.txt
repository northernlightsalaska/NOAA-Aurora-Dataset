FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 249
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 06 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY RETURNED TO HIGH LEVELS. REGION
5669 (S17W23) PRODUCED AN M5/1B AT 05/2223Z WITH A 10CM BURST
OF 370 F.U.  THIS REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M4/2B AT 05/2146Z WITH
A 10CM BURST OF 1100 F.U., AND AN M1/SN AT 06/0052Z. THE REGION
WAS STABLE IN AREA DURING THE PERIOD BUT EVOLUTION AND SOME
PROPER MOTION WAS OBSERVED. REGION 5672 (N24E06) CONTINUED TO
EMERGE AND IS NOW A MODERATE SIZE CLASS E GROUP. THIS REGION
PRODUCED AN M1/SN AT 05/2434Z. SEVERAL SMALL REGIONS ARE
ROTATING OVER THE NORTHEAST LIMB AND EMERGING IN THE NORTHEAST
QUADRANT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
GENERALLY MODERATE WITH HIGH LEVEL CLASS M AND CLASS X FLARES
POSSIBLE. REGION 5669 SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY SOURCE FOR THOSE
EVENTS. SHOULD GROWTH CONTINUE IN REGION 5672, IT COULD
BECOME A PRODUCER OF DAILY OR MORE FREQUENT CLASS M FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED AT MID LATITUDES AND
MOSTLY ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES. SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS
WERE EXPERIENCING MINOR STORM CONDITIONS NEAR THE END OF THE
PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE GENERALLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS IN
RESPONSE TO CONTINUED M FLARE ACTIVITY FROM REGION 5669.
PERIODS AT MINOR STORM LEVELS ARE POSSIBLE. REGION 5669 IS
STILL CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LARGE FLARES WHICH COULD RESULT
IN A PROTON EVENT AND PCA.
