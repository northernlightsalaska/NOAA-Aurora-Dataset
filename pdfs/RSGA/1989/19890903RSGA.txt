SDF NUMBER 246
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 03 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED HIGH. REGION 5669 (S17E15)
PRODUCED AN IMPULSIVE X1/1B FLARE AT 03/1432Z. A 5000 F.U. BURST
AT 10CM ACCOMPANIED THIS EVENT BUT NO METER WAVELENGTH BURSTS
WERE OBSERVED. REGION 5669 ALSO PRODUCED AN M4/1B AT 02/2236Z
THERE WAS NO DEFINITIVE OPTICAL CORRELATION WITH AN M5 FLARE AT
03/1044Z BUT REGION 5669 WAS THE LIKELY SOURCE. THIS REGION
CONTINUED TO GROW. A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SMALL
SPOTS IN REGION 5669 WAS REPORTED. INTENSE MAGNETIC GRADIENTS
AND STRONG MIXING OF POLARITIES WERE EVIDENT THROUGHOUT REGION
5669. TWO SMALL REGIONS (5675 AT N20W24 AND 5676 AT N27E75)
WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A HIGH LEVEL. MULTIPLE CLASS M FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM
REGION 5669. CLASS X FLARES ARE ALSO PREDICTED FROM THIS AREA
DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED DURING THE
PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
FORECAST TO REACH ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS IN RESPONSE TO RECENT FLARE ACTIVITY FROM REGION
5669. INTERMITTENT MAJOR STORM LEVELS ARE POSSIBLE BUT
CONTINUOUS MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTED AT THIS
TIME DUE TO THE LACK OF METER WAVELENGTH BURSTS WITH RECENT
ENERGETIC FLARES. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR A PROTON EVENT
AND PCA FROM FUTURE FLARES IN REGION 5669.
