SDF NUMBER 353
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 19 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5837 (N20E08)
PRODUCED AN M3/2B FLARE WITH ASSOCIATED TYPE II SWEEP AT
18/2342Z. THIS REGION HAS GROWN SINCE THE EVENT BOTH IN SPOT
STRUCTURE AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. SEVERAL LOW LEVEL C-CLASS
SUBFLARES HAVE ALSO BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THIS REGION. REGIONS
5844 (S10W66), 5846 (N19E28), AND 5847 (N34W69) CONTINUED TO
PRODUCE OCCASIONAL C-CLASS ACTIVITY. NUMEROUS UNCORRELATED
TYPE III SWEEPS AND BURST BETWEEN 245-610MHZ HAVE BEEN NOTED
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD INDICATING THE POSSIBLE RETURN OF REGION
5806 (N18 CARRINGTON 034) OR ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT REGION. REGIONS
5848 (N26E68) AND 5849 (S08E74) WERE NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE WITH MOSTLY C-CLASS ACTIVITY EXPECTED FROM THE
AFFOREMENTIONED REGIONS. ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENTS ARE POSSIBLE
FROM REGION 5837 WITH ITS WEAK BETA-GAMMA MAGNETIC STRUCTURE.
REGION 5836 (N13W13) HAS REMAINED QUIET THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD
HOWEVER IT HAS GROWN IN MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY TO A BETA-GAMMA
REGION AGAIN AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS.
