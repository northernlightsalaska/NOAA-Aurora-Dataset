FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 160
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 09 JUN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5521 (S21W02)
PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS EVENTS TODAY. THE FIRST FLARE WAS A LONG
DURATION M2/2F WHICH ATTAINED MAXIMUM AT 0030Z AND LASTED ABOUT
TWO HOURS. THE EVENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERATE TYPE II AND
TYPE IV RADIO SWEEPS. THE SECOND FLARE WAS AN M1/SF AT 1635Z.
THIS REGION EXHIBITED STEADY DECAY AND SIMPLIFICATION THROUGHOUT
THE PERIOD. REGION 5528 (N21E62) NOW DOMINATES THE DISK IN
SIZE (1580 MILLIONTHS) AND PLAGE COVERAGE BUT PRODUCED ONLY
OCCASIONAL SMALL SUBFLARES. NEW REGION 5533 (S18E78) ROTATED
INTO VIEW TODAY, PRODUCING FREQUENT SUBFLARE FLUCTUATIONS
INCLUDING AN M1 AT 1635Z. AN UNCORRELATED M2 OCCURRED AT 2029Z.
THE REMAINDER OF THE SOLAR DISK AND LIMBS WERE RELATIVELY
QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5521 AND 5528 ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO
PRODUCE MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. REGIONS 5530 AND 5533 MAY ALSO
CONTRIBUTE TO MODERATE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS DISTURBED BEGINNING WITH YESTERDAY'S
SUDDEN IMPULSE AT 08/1955Z THROUGH ABOUT 09/0600Z. CONDITIONS
WERE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WITH OCCASIONAL PERIODS
OF MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS AT HIGH LATITUDES. SUBSEQUENTLY
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD DECLINED TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS WITH
OCCASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR
THE DISTURBANCE WAS THE M6/2F FLARE FROM REGION 5521
THAT OCCURRED LATE ON 04 JUNE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
EFFECTS FROM YESTERDAY'S ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE AND TODAY'S
LONG DURATION EVENT MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED LEVELS
OF GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY.
