FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 231
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 19 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 5643 (N16W15)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE PERIOD: A C8/SF AT 0256Z.
THIS REGION CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST, MOST COMPLICATED
GROUP ON THE VISIBLE DISK. IT APPEARS TO BE IN A SLOW DECAY
PHASE AS ITS LARGE PENUMBRAL STRUCTURE IS GRADUALLY FRAGMENTING.
A LONG DURATION C8 X-RAY EVENT BEGAN AT 1913Z, ATTAINED MAXIMUM
AT 2009Z AND IS DECAYING GRADUALLY AT THIS TIME. THE LACK OF ANY
OPTICAL CORRELATION SUGGESTS THAT OLD REGION 5629 IS STILL
MAKING ITS PRESENCE FELT, EVEN THOUGH IT IS THREE DAYS BEHIND
THE LIMB. MODEST DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS AND A MODERATE TYPE II
SWEEP WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. THE REMAINDER OF THE
DISK WAS RELATIVELY QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 5643 AND 5645 (N28E10) ARE THE PRIMARY
THREATS FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS OCCURRED FROM 18/2100-19/0730Z.
ACTIVITY LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WERE QUIET TO
UNSETTLED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A BRIEF ACTIVE PERIOD AT HIGH
LATITUDES FROM 19/1800-2100Z. A PROTON EVENT AND A PCA EVENT
ARE STILL IN PROGRESS. PARTICLE FLUXES WERE DECLINING FOR MOST
OF THE DAY UNTIL 1735Z WHEN A GRADUAL INCREASE BECAME APPARENT
ON LOW AND HIGH ENERGY CHANNELS. THE PEAK FLUX DURING THE
LAST 24 HOURS AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV WAS 150 PARTICLES AT
1920Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE TOMORROW AND GENERALLY
ACTIVE FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS. INCREASED GEOMAGNETIC
ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN RESPONSE TO FILAMENT MATERIAL WHICH
DISAPPEARED FROM THE DISK EARLY ON THE 18TH.
