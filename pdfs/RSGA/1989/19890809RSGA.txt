SDF NUMBER 221
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 09 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  REGION 5629 (S17W07) IS
STILL THE MOST IMPRESSIVE REGION ON THE DISK.  THIS REGION IS
LARGE (OVER 1300 MILLIONTHS), COMPLEX (EKC WITH DELTAS), AND
DYNAMIC (AFS, ADF, AND NUMEROUS BRIGHTENINGS) BUT SURPRISINGLY,
FLARE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LOW.  HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE CHANGING.
REGION 5629 PRODUCED THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE DAY A C9.2/1N AT
09/1429UT AND IS SHOWING SIGNS OF FRAGMENTING.  IT IS THE MAIN
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE HIGH RADIO FLUX VALUES BEING OBSERVED.
REGION 5622 (S26W64) THE M FLARE PRODUCER A FEW DAYS AGO APPEARS
TO BE DECLINING AS IT APPROACHES THE WEST LIMB.  REGION 5639
(N28E69) APPEARS TO BE THE RETURN OF REGION 5603 (N28 L-360),
WHICH PRODUCED AN X2 PROTON FLARE ON ITS WEST LIMB TRANSIT ON
25 JULY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  REGION 5629 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE AT LEAST ONE
MAJOR FLARE BEFORE ITS WEST LIMB TRANSIT ON 16 AUGUST.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 21 GAMMAS WAS
OBSERVED AT 09/1831UT PROBABLY A RESULT OF THE M7.6/1B FLARE
ON 07 AUG AT 2058UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEAR FUTURE.
THERE IS A CHANCE FOR A PROTON EVENT.
