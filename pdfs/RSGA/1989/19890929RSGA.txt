FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 272
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 29 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5698 (S26W105)
PRODUCED A POWERFUL X9 FLARE AT 29/1133Z. A LOOP PROMINENCE
SYSTEM WAS OBSERVED TO ARISE FROM THE FLARE SITE OVER THE LIMB.
THIS 4 HOUR LONG FLARE ALSO PRODUCED A MODERATE INTENSITY TYPE
IV BURST, AND AT 10CM, A BURST OF 6800 F.U. WAS OBSERVED. REGION
5698 ALSO PRODUCED A NON-ENERGETIC BRIGHT SURGE TO 0.5R BETWEEN
29/0528-0648Z. REGION 5712 (S18E45) REMAINED STABLE AND
PRODUCED A FEW CLASS C FLARES. THIS REGION DISPLAYED SOME MINOR
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AND WAS STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BECOME
MODERATE. REGION 5698 WILL BE OCCULTED BY THE WEST LIMB
SUFFICIENTLY THAT A REPEAT OF THE FLARE TODAY WOULD RESULT
IN ONLY A MID CLASS M FLARE. REGION 5712 APPEARS CAPABLE OF
PRODUCING A CLASS M FLARE EVERY ONE TO TWO DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET DURING THE
PAST 24 HOURS. THE GEOPHYSICAL EVENT OF NOTE IS THE PROTON
EVENT FROM THE X9 FLARE. THE GT 10MEV FLUXES PASSED THRESHOLD
AT 29/1205Z. AT 29/2100Z, THE GT 10 MEV FLUX WAS AT 3100 P.F.U.
THE GT 100 MEV FLUX PASSED ITS EVENT THRESHOLD AT 29/1320Z AND
A MAXIMUM OF 310 P.F.U. OCCURRED AT 29/1955Z. A PCA
BEGAN NEAR 29/1158Z AND A MAXIMUM OF APPROXIMATELY 16 DB
ABSORPTION OCCURRED NEAR 29/2100Z. NEUTRON MONITORS RECORDED
A 500 PERCENT INCREASE OVER BACKGROUND, MAKING THIS A MAJOR
GROUND LEVEL EVENT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR 30 SEP-01 OCT DUE TO A
FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE ON 26-27 SEP. MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR 02 OCT IN RESPONSE TO THE X9
FLARE OBSERVED TODAY. IN THE ABSENCE OF FURTHER FLARES FROM
REGION 5698 BEHIND THE LIMB, THE MAJOR PROTON EVENT AND PCA
IN PROGRESS SHOULD DECAY SLOWLY DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS
TO NEAR BACKGROUND LEVELS.
