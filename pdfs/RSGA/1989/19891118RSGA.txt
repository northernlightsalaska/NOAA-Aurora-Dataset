FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 322
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 18 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5793 (S26W21)
PRODUCED AN M7/3B FLARE AT 1647Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
MODERATE DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. THE EVENT WAS MOST REMARKABLE
IN ITS GRADUAL RISE AND FALL SIGNATURE, WITH A LONG DURATION
THAT KEPT THE X-RAY FLUX ABOVE M-LEVEL FOR NEARLY FOUR HOURS
FROM 1600-2000Z. THE REGION EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH
DURING THE PERIOD AND HAS A FAIRLY COMPLICATED MAGNETIC
STRUCTURE. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLARE ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF
A FEW C-CLASS SUBFLARES. REGION 5786 (N12W78), SO IMPRESSIVE
A FEW DAYS AGO, CONTINUED TO DECAY AND SIMPLIFY QUIETLY.
SURGE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED ON EAST LIMB AT N28. (NOTE:
DUE TO THE M7 FLARE AND ASSOCIATED BURST ACTIVITY THE 1700Z
10.7CM FLUX MEASUREMENT WAS NOT AVAILABLE. AN ESTIMATE BASED
ON THE 1400Z MEASUREMENT IS INCLUDED IN PART IV. BELOW.)
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THE PRIMARY THREAT FOR ACTIVITY IS REGION
5793.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS. THE GEOMAGNETIC STORM WHICH BEGAN AT 17/0925Z APPEARS
TO HAVE ENDED AS OF 18/1200Z. DURING THE DISTURBANCE, MID-
LATITUDES WERE AT MOSTLY MAJOR STORM LEVELS AND HIGH LAT-
ITUDES WERE AT MOSTLY SEVERE STORM LEVELS. CONDITIONS
SUBSIDED TO PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE DAY. AN ENHANCEMENT WAS OBSERVED IN THE GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTON FLUXES BEGINNING AT 18Z BUT EVENT LEVEL WAS
NOT ATTAINED AS OF 2100Z. THE INCREASE WAS PROBABLY A RESULT
OF TODAY'S M7 FLARE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS. THE
ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TOMORROW AS A RESPONSE TO THE X1 FLARE
OF 16 NOVEMBER, AND ON THE SECOND DAY AS A RESULT OF TODAY'S
FLARE. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO UNSETTLED TO
ACTIVE LEVELS BY THE THIRD DAY.
