FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 331
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 27 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5799 (N21W68)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS EVENT: AN M1/1B FLARE AT 1739Z.
THE REST OF THE DAY WAS CHARACTERIZED BY OCCASIONAL C-CLASS
SUBFLARES FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REGIONS. REGION 5808
(S05W34) SLOWED DOWN FROM ITS INITIAL RAPID GROWTH PHASE AND IS
NOW THE LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK. BOTH REGION 5808 AND 5800
(N26W20) SHOW SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 5800 AND 5808 SHOW THE MOST PROMISE FOR
PRODUCING M-CLASS OR BETTER FLARES. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A
CHANCE FOR MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY FROM THESE TWO REGIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. AN ENHANCEMENT
IN THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PARTICLES BEGAN AROUND 1200UT AND
ATTAINED EVENT LEVEL AT 2000UT. THE MAXIMUM FLUX OBSERVED
DURING THE PERIOD WAS 14 PFU AT GREATER THAN 10MEV AT 2005Z.
NOTE: A SUDDEN IMPULSE OCCURRED AFTER THE PERIOD'S END
AT 2141UT. THE IMPULSE MEASURED ALMOST 40 GAMMA IN BOULDER.
A JUMP IN THE GREATER THAN 10MEV PARTICLES OCCURRED AT THE
SAME TIME, RAISING LEVELS TO 49 PFU AT 2140Z. THE PARTICLE
ENHANCEMENT AND THE SHOCK ARE MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH
THE LONG DURATION M4/2B FLARE THAT OCCURRED ON THE 26TH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
TWO DAYS AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE CONTINUES. CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS BY THE
THIRD DAY.
