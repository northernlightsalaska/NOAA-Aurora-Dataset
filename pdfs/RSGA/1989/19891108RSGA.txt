FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 312
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 08 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 5769 (N26W58)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE PAST DAY, AN M9/2B AT
08/1912Z AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 10.7 CM RADIO BURST OF
819 FLUX UNITS.  THIS FLARE OCCURRED DURING AN M2/1N FLARE IN
THE AREA SURROUNDING REGIONS 5781 (N12W04) AND 5783 (N19E16).
REGION 5769 ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/1F AT 08/0755Z.  REGION
5776 N17W12) CONTINUES TO DECAY AND GENERATED AN M3/2N AT
08/0609Z.  GROWTH CONTINUED IN THE AREA NEAR REGION 5784
(N23E36).  MAGNETIC ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THIS AREA IS A
SINGLE, ELONGATED, BIPOLAR GROUP.  REGION 5783 HAS STARTED TO
DECAY AND HAS PRODUCED SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES IN ADDITION TO
THE M-FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE.  REGION 5786 (N11E51) HAS SOME
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY, BUT HAS BEEN FAIRLY QUIET SINCE ITS M8/2B
FLARE YESTERDAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH.  HIGH LEVEL M-CLASS FLARES, AND POSSIBLY X-CLASS, ARE
EXPECTED.  REGIONS 5769, 5776, 5783, AND 5786 ARE POSSIBLE
CANDIDATES FOR ENERGETIC ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO ACTIVE.  A SUDDEN IMPULSE
WAS OBSERVED AT 08/1122Z (36 NANOTESLA AT BOULDER).  THE PRECISE
SOURCE OF THIS ACTIVITY IS UNKNOWN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS AS A RESULT
OF THE PAST FEW DAYS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY.
