SDF NUMBER 314
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 10 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  SEVERAL M-CLASS FLARES
WERE OBSERVED SINCE YESTERDAY.  THE LARGEST WAS AN M5/2B AT
10/1653Z IN REGION 5769 (N24W87).  THIS REGION CONTINUES TO
DECAY AS IT APPROACHES THE WEST LIMB.  REGION 5783 (N18W13)
CONTRIBUTED TO AT LEAST FOUR M-CLASS FLARES, THE LARGEST OF
WHICH WAS AN M3/1N AT 10/0155Z.  THIS REGION CONTINUES TO GROW
AND IS NOW A LARGE, COMPACT SUNSPOT GROUP WITH SIGNIFICANT
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.  NEW REGION 5788 (S23E69) PRODUCED AN
M2/2B FLARE AT 10/1948Z.  THIS REGION IS THE RETURN OF OLD
REGIONS 5747 AND 5748.  SEVERAL SMALL SPOTS ARE VISIBLE IN
THIS AREA AND MOST LIKELY CONSTITUTE MORE THAN ONE SEPARATE
ACTIVE REGION.  CONSEQUENTLY, THIS AREA MAY BE RENUMBERED
AFTER ALL OF THE SPOTS ROTATE INTO VIEW.  NEW REGION
5787 (S16W24) WAS ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH.  HIGH LEVEL M-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED.  X-CLASS FLARES
ARE POSSIBLE.  REGIONS 5783, 5786, AND 5788 ARE THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCES OF THIS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
