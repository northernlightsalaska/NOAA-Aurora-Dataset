SDF NUMBER 041
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 10 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5355 (N21E20)
PRODUCED AN X1/3B FLARE AT 10/0436Z. A SIGNIFICANT TYPE II SWEEP
(ESTIMATED SHOCK SPEED 800 KM/SEC) ACCOMPANIED THE EVENT, ALONG
WITH MINOR DISCRETE FREQUENCY BURSTS. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED
TYPE II SWEEP OCCURRED AT 10/0534Z WITH AN ESTIMATED VELOCITY
OF 800 KM/SEC. ANOTHER WEAK TYPE II SWEEP OCCURRED AT 10/1245Z
WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 1N FLARE FROM REGION 5356 (S16E44).
REGION 5354 (N30E02) REMAINED VERY COMPLEX IN STRUCTURE, BUT
WAS RELATIVELY QUIET DURING THE PERIOD. THERE ARE SIGNS THIS
REGION MAY BE ENTERING A SLOW DECAY PHASE. TWO REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED TODAY: 5359 (S18E71) AND 5360 (N28E63). BOTH APPEAR TO
BE MAGNETICALLY SIMPLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5354 AND 5355 ARE CAPABLE OF MAJOR
FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE LEVELS OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES
MIDWAY THROUGH THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD DUE TO RECENT
MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING MAY OCCUR ON
DAY THREE FOR THE SAME REASON.
