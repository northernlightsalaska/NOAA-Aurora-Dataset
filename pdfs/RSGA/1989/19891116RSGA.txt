FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 320
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 16 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5786 (N13W48)
PRODUCED AN X1/2B AT 16/1326Z. A 460 SFU TENFLARE, MAJOR
TYPE II RADIO SWEEP (EST. SHOCK SPEED 2000 KM/SEC), AND
SIGNIFICANT TYPE IV RADIO SWEEP ACCOMPANIED THE FLARE. THE
REGION APPEARED TO BE IN A STATE OF GENERAL DECAY, ESPECIALLY
IN THE TRAILER PORTION. HOWEVER, THE LEADER PORTION RETAINED
ITS VERY COMPLEX MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. REGION 5788 WAS SPLIT INTO
TWO SEPARATE REGIONS. THE LEADING SEGMENT RETAINED NUMBER 5788
(S22W12) AND WAS GRADUALLY DECAYING. THE TRAILING PORTION WAS
NUMBERED 5793 (S25E03) AND WAS STABLE. IN ADDITION, 5794
(N07W28) AND 5795 (S09E59) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THOUGH DECAYING, REGION 5786 EASILY HAS THE
POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING M-CLASS FLARES AND AN ISOLATED X-CLASS
FLARE. C-CLASS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED FROM REGIONS 5788 AND 5793.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE FIRST
TWO DAYS SUBSIDING TO ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE FINAL DAY. THE
STORMING IS EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO YESTERDAY'S MAJOR FLARE
ACTIVITY.
