IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY CONTINUES MODERATE. REGION 5669
(S18W50) GENERATED TWO M-CLASS FLARES, AN M1/0B AT 07/2117Z
AND AN M1/0F AT 0409Z. THE REGION DECAYED SLIGHTLY DURING THE
DAY. REGION 5676 (N27E10) PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 0338Z, AND
REGION 5680 (N16E52) YIELDED THE LAST M-LEVEL FLARE OF THE
INTERVAL, AN M1/1N AT 1803Z. ALTHOUGH THE MOST IMPRESSIVE

IS ANTICIPATED FROM THAT SITE OR, TO A LESSER DEGREE, FROM
REGIONS 5676 OR 5680. NEWLY NUMBERED REGION 5689 MAY ALSO
REVEAL ITSELF TO BE A POTENTIAL M-CLASS PRODUCER.
