IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. FIVE C-CLASS SUBFLARES
OCCURRED. REGION 5786 (N13W23) DISPLAYED STRONG PENUMBRAL GROWTH
WITHIN ITS INTERMEDIATE SPOTS. A DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION
ALSO DEVELOPED WITHIN THE SAME AREA. IN CONTRAST, REGION 5783

MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5786 AND 5783 ARE THE PRIME THREATS
FOR M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION. REGION 5786 ALSO HAS THE
POTENTIAL FOR AN ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARE, ESPECIALLY IF ITS
PRESENT RATE OF GROWTH PERSISTS.
