SDF NUMBER 283
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 10 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED
C6 FLARE WAS OBSERVED AT 10/1338Z WITH A 10CM BURST OF 120 F.U.
OCCASIONAL MINOR SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED FROM SEVERAL OTHER DISK
REGIONS. A NEW REGION, AS YET UNNUMBERED, IS TRAVERSING THE EAST
LIMB AT S14 WITH CONTINUAL SURGING AND MAY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE
OF THE C6 FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE. SEVERAL SMALL REGIONS WERE
NUMBERED - 5737 (S12W02), 5738 (N12E35), AND 5739 (S20E41).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANTLY LOW. MODERATE ACTIVITY LEVELS ARE POSSIBLE
FROM REGIONS NEAR OR JUST BEYOND THE EAST LIMB. OLD
REGION 5698 IS DUE TO RETURN LATE ON 11 OCT NEAR S25.
THIS REGION PRODUCED 8 CLASS M FLARES AND 1 CLASS X FLARE
LAST ROTATION INCLUDING THE X9 FLARE ON 29 SEP WHICH
CAUSED THE VERY STRONG GROUND LEVEL EVENT THAT DAY. IT IS
LIKELY OLD REGION 5698 WILL BE LESS ACTIVE THIS TRANSIT.
