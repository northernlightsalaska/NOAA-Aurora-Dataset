FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 032
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 01 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5334 (S21W09)
PRODUCED ALL OF TODAY'S M-CLASS FLARES: THE LARGEST WAS AN M3/1N
AT 1038Z, WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SYMPATHETIC SUBFLARING FROM
REGION 5329 (N20W81). REGION 5334 SHOWED SIGNS OF DECAY IN PEN-
UMBRAL COVERAGE AND SIMPLIFICATION OF ITS MAGNETIC STRUCTURE
FROM A DELTA CONFIGURATION TO A BETA-GAMMA CLASSIFICATION.
ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES PRODUCED BY THE REGION WERE AN M1/1N
AT 2121Z AND AN M1/SN AT 0205Z. A 40 DEGREE FILAMENT CENTERED
AT ABOUT N49E20 DISAPPEARED FROM THE SOLAR DISK BETWEEN 0711Z
AND 1159Z. A NEW REGION 5344 (N09W49) EMERGED ON THE DISK.
SURGE AND LOOP PROMINENCE ACTIVITY WAS VISIBLE ON THE WEST
LIMB AT N17 ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXIT OF REGION 5329.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5334 IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES ALTHOUGH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE LESS FREQUENT AND LESS
INTENSE THAN THE PREVIOUS FEW DAYS. OLD REGION 5312 (S33, L-300
MAX CLASS/AREA FKC/1800 ON 15 JAN), WHICH PRODUCED 33 M-CLASS
FLARES AND 6 X-CLASS FLARES ON ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT IS DUE TO
RETURN ON 03 FEBRUARY AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ACTIVITY AND
BACKGROUND FLUX LEVELS AT THAT TIME.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM LEVELS DURING THE PERIOD. A PERIOD OF MINOR TO MAJOR
STORM CONDITIONS OCCURRED FROM 1800-2400Z YESTERDAY, AND
GEOSTATIONARY MAGNETOMETERS (GOES-6) RECORDED A MAGNETOPAUSE
CROSSING JUST BEFORE 31/2200Z. A SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED
AT 1030Z AND AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS FOLLOWED FROM 01/1030-1300Z. THE DISTURBANCE APPEARED
TO HAVE SUBSIDED NEAR THE END OF THE DAY. THIS ACTIVITY IS
THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SOLAR ACTIVITY THAT
OCCURRED ON 30-31 JANUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR MOST OF TOMMOROW, WITH
A FAIR CHANCE FOR ISOLATED SUBSTORMS NEAR LOCAL MIDNIGHT.
CONDITIONS SHOULD BE UNSETTLED THEREAFTER UNTIL 04 FEBRUARY
WHEN AN INCREASE TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS IS FORECAST DUE TO THE
FILAMENT DISAPPEARENCE THAT OCCURRED TODAY.
