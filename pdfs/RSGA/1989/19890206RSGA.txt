FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 037
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 06 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5354 (N32E55)
ROTATED FULLY INTO VIEW AS A LARGE, MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX GROUP.
IT PRODUCED THREE M-CLASS FLARES DURING THE PERIOD: AN M1/SN AT
06/0217Z, AN M1/SF AT 06/0931Z, AND AN M1/SF AT 06/1921Z. NO
SIGNIFICANT RADIO EMISSIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THESE
FLARES. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE, LOCATED AT N37E90, OCCURRED AT
06/1714Z AND REACHED A VERTICAL EXTENT OF 0.32RV. THIS
ERUPTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN M2 X-RAY BURST AND A STRONG
TYPE II RADIO SWEEP (WITH AN ESTIMATED VELOCITY OF 1400 KM/SEC).
NEW REGION 5355 (N20E68) ROTATED INTO VIEW AS A SIMPLE BIPOLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE FOR AN M-CLASS FLARE
AND A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN X-CLASS FLARE FROM REGION 5354.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR STORMING OCCURRED AT
HIGH LATITUDES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE PERIOD. THIS
ACTIVITY IS PROBABLY THE RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF A CORONAL
HOLE PRESENTLY SITUATED IN THE NORTHWEST SOLAR QUADRANT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS BECOMING
UNSETTLED ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. BRIEF
PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING ARE ALSO POSSIBLE TOMORROW DUE TO
A CONTINUATION OF THE CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS MENTIONED ABOVE.
