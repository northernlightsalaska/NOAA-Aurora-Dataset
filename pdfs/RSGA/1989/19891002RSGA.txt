SDF NUMBER 275
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 02 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5712 (S18E03)
PRODUCED A 3 HOUR LONG M1/1N FLARE AT 02/0916Z. MINOR
CENTIMETRIC BURSTS ACCOMPANIED THIS EVENT. REGION 5712 REMAINED
STABLE AS A CLASS F GROUP WITH MINOR MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
TWO SMALL TO POSSIBLY MODERATE SIZE REGIONS ROTATED OVER THE
EAST LIMB - 5722 (S14E62) AND 5723 (N18E77).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANTLY LOW. REGION 5712 HAS THE CAPABILITY OF
PRODUCING ISOLATED CLASS M FLARES DURING THE PERIOD.
REGIONS NEAR THE EAST LIMB MAY ALSO BE CAPABLE OF ISOLATED
CLASS M FLARE PRODUCTION BUT CONFIDENT PREDICTIONS MUST
AWAIT LESS FORESHORTENED OBSERVATIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED DURING THE
PERIOD. THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE EXPECTED FROM THE X9 FLARE
ON 29 SEP FAILED TO MATERIALIZE. THE PROTON EVENT REMAINED
IN PROGRESS. THE GREATER THAN 10MEV FLUX WAS 85 P.F.U. AT
01/2100Z AND DECAYED SLOWLY TO 37 P.F.U. AT 02/2100Z. THE
POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT WAS ALSO ENDING NEAR THE END OF
THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR HIGH LATITUDES ON 05 OCT.
THE PROTON EVENT SHOULD CONTINUE TO DECAY, ENDING ON 03-04 OCT.
