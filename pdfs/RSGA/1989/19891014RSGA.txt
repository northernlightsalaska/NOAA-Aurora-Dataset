SDF NUMBER 287
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 14 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE
SUNSPOTS NEAR THE SOUTHEAST LIMB SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE TWO
ABUTTED ACTIVE REGIONS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE LARGER COLLECTION
OF SUNSPOTS TO THE EAST HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED REGION NUMBER 5747
(S26E67).  THIS IS THE SITE OF A FAIRLY LARGE, COMPACT GROUP
OF SPOTS.  REGION 5744 (S23E50) IS A SMALLER, LESS COMPLEX,
BIPOLAR SUNSPOT GROUP TO THE WEST.  ALTHOUGH REGION 5747
APPEARS SIGNIFICANT, IT HAS PRODUCED ONLY C-LEVEL ACTIVITY
SINCE YESTERDAY.  OTHER REGIONS NUMBERED TODAY INCLUDE 5746
(N05W12) AND 5748 (S17E68).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  ENERGETIC ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED FROM REGION 5747.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:

EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
