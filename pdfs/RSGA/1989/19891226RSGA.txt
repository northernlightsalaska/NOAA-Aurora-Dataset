FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 360
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 26 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5852 (S26E05) PRO-
DUCED TWO MAJOR FLARES: AN M5/1N AT 0538Z ACCOMPANIED BY FAIRLY
STRONG RADIO BURSTS, AND AN M6/1B AT 1815Z ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST
RADIO BURSTS. THIS REGION CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE PERIOD
AND POSSESSES A MAGNETIC DELTA CONFIGURATION. AN ADDITIONAL M-
CLASS EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY THE LARGEST REGION 5854 (N24E28):
AN M2/1F AT 0750Z. THE REST OF THE ACTIVITY WAS CHARACTERIZED
BY FREQUENT SUBFLARES FROM A VARIETY OF REGIONS, PRIMARILY
5852 AND 5854.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. THE EVOLUTION OF 5852 APPEARS TO BE ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE
FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MAGNETIC FIELD SHEARING AND CONTINUED MAJOR
FLARE PRODUCTION. REGION 5854 ALSO HAS POTENTIAL FOR LARGE
FLARES IF THE RIGHT TRIGGER MECHANISM MATERIALIZES. REGION 5853
(N09E26) CONTINUES TO POSE SOMEWHAT OF A FLARE THREAT FOR AT
LEAST M-CLASS EVENTS AS IT MAINTAINS SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET UNTIL SHORTLY AFTER
0900Z WHEN CONDITIONS BECAME UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. MINOR
STORMING WAS OBSERVED LATE IN THE PERIOD, BEGINNING ABOUT
1400Z AT HIGH LATITUDES AND AT ABOUT 1930Z AT MIDDLE
LATITUDES. ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY, THIS INCREASE
APPEARS TO BE THE BEGINNING OF RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS
WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS FORECASTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS,
WITH SOME PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING, ESPECIALLY ON THE SECOND
DAY. THE CURRENT ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS THE CORONAL
HOLE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE IN A FAVORABLE POSITION OVER THE NEXT
THREE DAYS. EFFECTS FROM YESTERDAY'S DISAPPEARING FILAMENT AND
FROM TODAY'S LONG DURATION M5 EVENT MIGHT COMBINE TO GIVE THE
ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENT ON THE SECOND DAY.
