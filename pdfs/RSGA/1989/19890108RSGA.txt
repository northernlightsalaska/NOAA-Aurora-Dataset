FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 008
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 08 JAN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5312 (S31E53)
PRODUCED AN M7/1B FLARE AT 1253Z WITH PARALLEL RIBBONS, SEVERAL
ERUPTIVE CENTERS AND MODERATE SIZED DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. THE
GROUP IS MAGNETICALLY COMPLICATED WITH STRONG FIELDS AND
GRADIENTS IN A DELTA CONFIGURATION, AND HAS SHOWN CONTINUED
GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD. AN M5 FLARE OCCURRED AT 1717Z WITHOUT
ANY SIGNATURE IN OPTICAL WAVELENGTHS, SUGGESTING THAT AN EVENT
OCCURRED BEHIND ONE OF THE SOLAR LIMBS. REGION 5311 (S14E33)
GREW SIGNIFICANTLY AND APPEARED TO HAVE EVOLVED TO A MAGNETIC
DELTA CONFIGURATION BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE EAST LIMB
WAS ACTIVE TODAY: CORONAGRAPH OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SEVERAL
CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS OCCURRED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS; PROMINENCE
ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED AT S30, N20, AND N32, AND SURGE ACTIVITY
WAS OBSERVED AT ABOUT N30. EXITING REGION 5301 (S18W92) ALSO
PRODUCED STRONG SURGING DURING THE DAY WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY
BRIGHT FROM 0219-0520Z. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES OBSERVED FOR
THE PERIOD WERE AN M1 AT 2257Z, AN M2 AT 0654Z, AN M1/SF FROM
5310 (S25E10) AT 1509Z, AN M1/SF FROM 5312 AT 1908Z, AN M1/SF
FROM 5311 AT 1910Z, AND AN M1 AT 1955Z. THE SOLAR BACKGROUND
LEVELS WERE ELEVATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITH THE 10CM FLUX AT
268 SFU AND THE X-RAY BACKGROUND AT APPROXIMATELY C6.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. REGION 5312 IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS THE MAIN SOURCE
OF ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WILL PROBABLY PRODUCE
ADDITIONAL CLASS M5 OR GREATER FLARES. REGION 5311 IS EXPECTED
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY AND OLD REGION
5278 (N28, L-275), WHICH IS EXPECTED TO RETURN SHORTLY SHOULD
ALSO RAISE ACTIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS WHEN IT APPEARS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET UNTIL ABOUT 1200Z WHEN
CONDITIONS BECAME GENERALLY ACTIVE WITH SOME MINOR STORM
PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE BEEN
CAUSED BY THE CORONAL MASS EJECTION/SOLAR FLARE ACTIVITY
WHICH OCCURRED LATE ON THE 6TH AND EARLY ON THE 7TH OR BY
A CORONAL HOLE WHICH WAS OBSERVED TODAY AT N27E35.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE WITH OCCASIONAL MINOR STORM
PERIODS AT HIGHER LATITUDES FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE
CURRENT ACTIVITY PERSISTS. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO
GRADUALLY SUBSIDE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE
SECOND AND THIRD DAYS OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
