FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 313
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 09 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  EIGHT M-CLASS FLARES
WERE OBSERVED SINCE YESTERDAY.  TWO OF THESE REACHED M4 (AT
09/1458Z AND 09/1939Z) AND WERE BOTH LOCATED IN REGION 5783
(N19E01).  THE FLARE AT 09/1939Z IN REGION 5783 OVERLAPPED
WITH AN M1/1N FLARE, WHICH REACHED A MAXIMUM AT 09/1905Z, IN
REGION 5786 (N12E42).  REGION 5783 HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT
PENUMBRAL GROWTH IN THE LEADER SUNSPOTS SINCE YESTERDAY AND
APPEARS TO CONTAIN A DELTA CONFIGURATION.  REGION 5786 HAS
GROWN SLIGHTLY SINCE YESTERDAY AND ALSO MAY CONTAIN A DELTA
IN THE TRAILER SPOT COMPLEX.  PLAGE IS ROTATING INTO VIEW
AT SE20, NEAR THE EXPECTED LOCATION OF OLD RETURNING REGIONS
5747 (S26 L-212) AND 5748 (S17 L-210), HOWEVER SIGNIFICANT
LIMB ACTIVITY HAS NOT YET BEEN OBSERVED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH.  ADDITIONAL HIGH LEVEL M-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED.
REGIONS 5783 AND 5786 ARE THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES OF THIS
ACTIVITY.  INITIAL OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT OLD REGIONS 5747
AND 5748 ARE NOT RETURNING AS ACTIVE AS WHEN THEY DEPARTED THE
DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO ACTIVE.  A GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTON EVENT WAS OBSERVED, AT SATELLITE ALTITUDES, TO
BEGIN AT 09/0240Z, REACH A MAXIMUM OF 43 PFU AT 09/0610Z, AND
END AT 09/1255Z.  THIS EVENT IS BELIEVED TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH YESTERDAY'S M9 FLARE IN REGION 5769 (N26W71).
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS FOR 10 NOVEMBER AND
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THEREAFTER.
