ISSUED 2200Z 29 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M4 (NO OPTICAL
CORRELATION) FLARE OCCURRED AT 29/0451Z. THIS SLOW RISING
EVENT STARTED AT 29/0221Z AND LASTED UNTIL 29/0617Z. OLD
REGION 5747 (S27, L-207) COULD HAVE PRODUCED THIS ACTIVITY.

(N21W01) AND 5769 (N23E69) LOOK TO BE THE MOST INTERESTING
SPOT GROUPS ON THE DISK. BOTH REGIONS ARE D-TYPE SPOT GROUPS
WITH INCREASING SPOT AREA AND SIMPLE BETA MAGNETIC
CONFIGURATIONS. TWO NEW SPOT REGIONS NUMBERED TODAY: 5770
(N18E59) AND 5771 (S17E69).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 5763 AND 5769 SHOW SOME POTENTIAL
FOR ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.

IS STILL IN PROGRESS. A PCA EVENT OCCURRED AT 29/0945Z AND
ENDED AT 29/1400Z. SOME MINOR ENHANCEMENT OF THE PROTON LEVELS
WAS OBSERVED FROM THE M4 FLARE.
