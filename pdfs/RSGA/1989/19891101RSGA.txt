FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 305
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 01 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE LARGEST EVENTS OF THE
PERIOD WERE A C8/SN AT 1510UT AND A C7/SF AT 1614UT.  REGION
5772 (S18E46) WAS THE APPARENT SOURCE OF THE 1510UT EVENT WHILE
REGION 5776 (N18E81) IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THE 1614UT EVENT.
REGION 5769 (N24E30) HAS BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET, PRODUCING ONLY
LOW LEVEL C EVENTS.  REGION 5769, ALTHOUGH LARGE IN WHITE LIGHT
AND H-ALPHA, APPEARS TO BE MAGNETICALLY SIMPLE BUT HAS EXPANDED
INTO REGION 5770 (N18E18).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 5769 AND 5776 ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
SMALL LEVEL M FLARES DURING THEIR DISK TRANSIT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY IN THE PERIOD DUE TO
CORONAL HOLE AND DSF EFFECTS.  THE FIELD SHOULD RETURN TO
BASICALLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS LATER IN THE PERIOD.
