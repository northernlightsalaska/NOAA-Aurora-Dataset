FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 181
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 30 JUN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. MOST OF TODAY'S
FLARE PRODUCTION WAS FROM REGION 5569 (N21W27), A FAIRLY
LARGE, MAGNETICALLY COMPLICATED REGION. IN ADDITION TO
NUMEROUS C-CLASS FLARES THE REGION PRODUCED AN M2/SN 1502Z AND
AN M2/SN AT 1739Z. THE GROUP APPEARS TO HAVE A DELTA CON-
FIGURATION IN THE TRAILER AND IS SLOWLY DECAYING AND ELONGATING.
REGION 5555 (N26W60) PRODUCED THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE DAY,
AN M3/2B AT 29/2127Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY LOOPS, MODERATE
DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS, AND A STRONG TYPE IV SWEEP. THE REGION
COOLED SIGNIFICANTLY THEREAFTER AND DID NOT PRODUCE ANY MORE
FLARES. NEW REGION 5572 (S16E68) ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY AND
PRODUCED AN M3 EVENT AT 0616Z. THE X-RAY LEVELS WERE ENHANCED
THROUGH 0923Z AND LOOPS WERE VISIBLE ON THE LIMB FROM 0622-
1455Z. THE REGION APPERAS TO BE A SMALL D-TYPE GROUP. THE
REMAINDER OF THE SOLAR DISK AND LIMBS WERE RELATIVELY QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE MAIN THREATS FOR MODERATE LEVELS ARE REGION 5563
(THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK), REGION 5569, AND REGION 5572.
THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR HIGH LEVELS OF ACTIVITY FROM
REGION 5569.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A
PERIOD OF UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS OCCURRED FROM
0130-0900Z. ENERGETIC PARTICLE MONITORS DETECTED AN ENHANCE-
MENT IN THE >10MEV RANGE FROM 29/2230-30/1500Z. EVENT LEVELS
WERE ATTAINED BRIEFLY BETWEEN 0655-0725Z WITH A PEAK FLUX
OF 17 PFU AT 0710Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TOMORROW AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY ACTIVE FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS. THE INCREASE
IN ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THE M3/2B FLARE AT
29/2127Z MENTIONED ABOVE.
