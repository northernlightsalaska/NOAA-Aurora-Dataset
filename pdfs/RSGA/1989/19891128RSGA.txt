FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 332
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 28 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 5800 (N26W20) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S LARGEST FLARE: A C8/1N AT 1025Z. THIS GROUP IS
UNDERGOING STEADY DECAY AND SIMPLIFICATION AND DID NOT PRODUCE
ANY OTHER FLARES. ADDITIONAL SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE
PERIOD: MOST OF THESE WERE FROM REGION 5809 (S18E44), A SMALL
E-TYPE GROUP WHICH IS SHOWING A SLIGHT GROWTH TREND. A STRONG
TYPE II SWEEP WAS REPORTED AT 27/2348Z. NO OPTICAL ASSOCIATIONS
COULD BE CONFIDENTLY MADE, BUT A 15 DEGREE FILAMENT NEAR N35E15
DID DISAPPEAR SOMETIME BETWEEN 27/1614Z AND 28/1553Z AND MIGHT
HAVE BEEN RELATED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE MOST PROBABLE SOURCES FOR M-CLASS EVENTS
ARE REGIONS 5800 AND 5809.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY ACTIVE. A SUDDEN IMPULSE
WAS OBSERVED AT 27/2141Z AND MEASURED ABOUT 40 GAMMA IN BOUL-
DER. THE DISTURBANCE CONTINUES IN PROGRESS AT THIS TIME. THE
PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN AT 27/2000Z INCREASED MARKEDLY AT
THE TIME OF THE SHOCK AND ATTAINED A MAXIMUM FLUX OF 380 PFU
AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV AT 28/1105Z. THE FLUX LEVELS ARE
DECLINING AT THIS TIME AS THE EVENT CONTINUES IN PROGRESS.
AFTER CLOSER EXAMINATION, IT APPEARS THAT THIS SHOCK IS
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE X1/2N FLARE OF
25/2355Z NOV RATHER THAN THE M4/2B FLARE AS WAS STATED
YESTERDAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT ACTIVE LEVELS TOMORROW AS EFFECTS FROM
THE M4/2B FLARE OF 26 NOVEMBER ARRIVE. CONDITIONS SHOULD SUB-
SIDE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS BY THE SECOND  DAY AND
SHOULD BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED BY THE THIRD DAY.
