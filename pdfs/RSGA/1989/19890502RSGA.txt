FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 122
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 02 MAY 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5470 (N30E36)
PRODUCED AN M2/1N FLARE AT 02/0416Z AND A LONG DURATION M1/1N AT
02/1640Z. THIS REGION CEASED GROWING AND STABILIZED IN WHITE
LIGHT AREA.   REGION 5470 REMAINED SOMEWHAT COMPLEX
MAGNETICALLY. REGION 5464 (S19W14) PRODUCED AN M3/2B FLARE
AT 02/1905Z. TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS ACCOMPANIED THE FLARE.
THIS REGION REMAINS STABLE IN AREA AND ALSO POSSESSES A
MODERATE AMOUNT OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A MODERATE LEVEL FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE CLASS M
FLARE PRODUCTION FROM REGION 5470 SHOULD BEGIN TO DECLINE
DUE TO THE RECENT STABILIZATION. ANOTHER CLASS M FLARE FROM
REGION 5464 IS POSSIBLE, BUT THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE
SHOULD BE LOW FROM THIS AGING REGION. A LOW PROBABILITY
EXISTS FOR A CLASS X FLARE FROM EITHER REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY ACTIVE FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS. A BELOW EVENT THRESHOLD PARTICLE ENHANCEMENT WAS
IN PROGRESS FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD. A MAXIMUM FLUX OF
APPROXIMATELY 6 PFU WAS OBSERVED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT ACTIVE TO OCCASIONALLY MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR
THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE M3 FLARE FROM REGION 5464 IS
EXPECTED TO CAUSE MINOR STORM CONDITIONS BEGINNING LATE ON
04 MAY AND CONTINUING INTO 05 MAY.
