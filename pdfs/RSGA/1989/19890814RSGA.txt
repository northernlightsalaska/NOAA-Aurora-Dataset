IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5629 (S17W72)
PRODUCED AN X3/3B TENFLARE WITH TYPE II AND IV AT 0053Z.
DISCRETE BURSTS IN THE THOUSANDS OF FLUX UNITS WERE RECORDED
ACROSS THE RADIO SPECTRUM. THE REGION ALSO GENERATED AN M2/1N
AT 1924Z. REGION 5643 (N16E35), SIMILAR IN SIZE AND STRUCTURE
TO 5629, YIELDED AN M1/1N AT 1016Z. REGION 5645 (N28E62) ALSO
CONTRIBUTED AN M1/1F AT 1205Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5629 AND 5643 BOTH REMAIN OMINOUS
AND ARE CAPABLE OF ISOLATED CLASS-X ACTIVITY. REGION 5645 MAY
PRODUCE M-LEVEL FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS SINCE THE SUDDEN COMMENCEMENT AT 0614Z. THE IMPULSE,
MEASURED AT 64 NANOTESLAS AT BOULDER, IS THOUGHT TO BE THE
RESULT OF THE X2/2B FLARE OF 12/1427Z. BOTH THE POLAR CAP
ABSORPTION AND SATELLITE PROTON EVENTS CONTINUED ALL DAY
BUT BOTH ARE SUBSIDING. THERE WAS NO DISCERNIBLE INCREASE
IN PROTON FLUXES EARLIER TODAY AFTER THE X3/3B EVENT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
AUGUST 16 SHOULD BE THE MOST DISTURBED DAY OF THE INTERVAL.
THE X3/3B FLARE OF EARLIER TODAY SHOULD AFFECT THE MAGNETO-
SPHERE AT THAT TIME.
