FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 363
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 29 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 5852 (S26W32)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE DAY, AN M9/1F AT 29/1826Z.
THIS REGION HAS AGAIN ENTERED A GROWTH PHASE, INCREASING BOTH
SUNSPOT AREA AND NUMBER.  MAGNETICALLY THIS REGION REMAINS QUITE
COMPLEX.  ANOTHER MAJOR FLARE, AN M8 AT 29/1105Z, WAS NOT
CORRELATED TO AN OPTICAL FLARE.  REGION 5858 (S18E13) IS
GROWING RAPIDLY AND HAS PRODUCED SEVERAL FLARES.  THE LARGEST
WAS AN M4/1B AT 28/2115Z.  NEW REGION 5864 (N12E69) WAS
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  ADDITIONAL MAJOR FLARES ARE EXPECTED IN
REGION 5852.  M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN REGIONS 5853
(S09W07), 5854 (N23W12), AND 5858.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS.  AN SSC WAS OBSERVED AT MIDDLE LATITUDE STATIONS (20 NT
AT BOULDER) AT 29/0654Z.  THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURBANCE IS MOST
LIKLEY FLARE RELATED, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR
ACTIVITY IN THE PAST FEW DAYS THE EXACT EVENT IS UNKNOWN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS.  THE PRESENT DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE
WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
