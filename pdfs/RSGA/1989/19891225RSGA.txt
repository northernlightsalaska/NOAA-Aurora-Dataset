FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 359
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 25 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5852 (S25E19)
PRODUCED TODAY'S LARGEST FLARE: AN M3/1N AT 2028Z. AN ADDITIONAL
M-FLARE WAS PRODUCED BY THIS REGION: AN M1/1N AT 1644Z. BOTH
EVENTS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST RADIO BURST ACTIVITY. THIS
REGION EXHIBITED RAPID GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD AND APPEARS TO
HAVE FORMED A MAGNETIC DELTA CONFIGURATION. AN ADDITIONAL M-
FLARE OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD: AN M2/2F FROM 5853 (S09E37)
AT 0039Z. THE REMAINDER OF ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF NUMEROUS SUB-
FLARES AT THE UPPER C-CLASS LEVEL FROM SEVERAL REGIONS: MOST
NOTABLY REGIONS 5854 (N24E42) AND 5850 (S28W60). A LARGE 20
DEGREE FILAMENT DISAPPEARED NEAR S30E25 SOMETIME BETWEEN 24/
1552Z AND 25/1500Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH A CHANCE FOR HIGH LEVELS. THE PREDOMINANT REGIONS
ARE RAPIDLY GROWING 5852, REGION 5854 (STILL THE LARGEST GROUP
ON THE DISK), AND REGION 5853 WHICH CONTINUES TO HAVE SOME MAG-
NETIC COMPLEXITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH A FEW BRIEF,
ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TOMORROW, BECOMING UNSETTLED
TO ACTIVE ON THE SECOND DAY, AND PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE WITH SOME
ISOLATED MINOR STORMING ON THE THIRD DAY. THE INCREASE IS FORE-
CAST BECAUSE OF THE COMBINED POSSIBILITIES OF EFFECTS FROM A
RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE, AND TODAY'S FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE.
