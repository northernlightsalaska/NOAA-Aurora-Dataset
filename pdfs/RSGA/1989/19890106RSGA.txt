FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 006
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 06 JAN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. NEW REGION 5312 (S30E72)
ROTATED INTO VIEW AND PRODUCED AN M8/1N FLARE AT 1805Z WITH A
WEAK TYPE II RADIO SWEEP. THE REGION PRODUCED STRONG SURGING
AND CORONAL LINE EMISSION THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND APPEARS TO BE
A LARGE COMPLICATED GROUP WITH STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS. ITS
LOCATION CORRESPONDS WELL WITH OLD REGION 5273 WHICH PRODUCED
SEVERAL M-CLASS FLARES AND AN X-CLASS FLARE ON ITS PREVIOUS
TRANSIT. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES OCCURRED: AN M1 AT 0508Z
WHICH WAS NOT OBSERVED OPTICALLY, AND AN M1/SN FROM REGION
5301 (S18W68) AT 1925Z. THE SOLAR DISK CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN
MATURE  GROUPS  WHICH  HAVE  ALL  EXHIBITED  BRIGHT  PLAGE
FLUCTUATIONS THROUGHOUT THE LATTER PART OF THE DAY. THIS HAS
BEEN EVIDENT IN THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE X-RAY BACKGROUND
LEVELS ABOVE C4 SINCE ABOUT 1500Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5301 (S18W68), 5303 (S19W83), 5305
(N11E16),  5307 (N28E27),  5309 (S18E43) ARE SUFFICIENTLY
DEVELOPED THAT EACH OF THEM POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR M-CLASS
FLARES. REGION 5312 (S30E72) IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MAIN SOURCE
OF ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WILL PROBABLY PRODUCE
ADDITIONAL CLASS M5 OR GREATER FLARES DURING ITS TRANSIT OF
THE DISK. OLD REGION 5278 (N28, L=275), WHICH PRODUCED TWO
X-CLASS FLARES ON ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT IS DUE TO RETURN ON
08-09 JANUARY AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE SOLAR ACTIVITY AND
BACKGROUND LEVELS AT THAT TIME.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINATELY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
