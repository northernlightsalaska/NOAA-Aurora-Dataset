FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 031
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 31 JAN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5334 (S21E04)
PRODUCED THE DAY'S LARGEST EVENT, AN M7/1N FLARE AT 1214Z WHICH
WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SIGNIFICANT RADIO BURSTS AND A STRONG TYPE II
SWEEP. THE EVENT WAS COMPLICATED BY SYMPATHETIC, TIME-COINCIDENT
FLARING FROM REGION 5330 (S18W36). A SIMILAR NEAR-SIMULTANEOUS
EVENT OCCURRED AS AN M1 FLARE AT 1740Z WITH 1N OPTICAL FLARES
OBSERVED FROM REGIONS 5334 AND 5329 (N19W69). TWO ADDITIONAL
M-FLARES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE DAY: AN M1/1N AT 0127Z AND
AN M1/1N AT 0306Z, BOTH OF WHICH WERE PRODUCED BY REGION 5334.
REGION 5334 DISPLAYED CONTINUED GROWTH AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY
DURING THE PERIOD WHEREAS REGIONS 5329 AND 5330 WERE OBSERVED
TO BE DECLINING AND LOSING INTENSITY. THREE NEW REGIONS ROTATED
INTO VIEW TODAY AND ONE NEW REGION EMERGED ON THE DISK.
PROMINENCE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED ON THE EAST LIMB AT ABOUT N30.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5334 IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES AND REGIONS 5329 AND 5330 CONTINUE TO POSE A THREAT FOR
MODERATE ACTIVITY AS WELL. OLD REGION 5312 (S33, L-300, MAX
CLASS/ AREA FKC/1800 ON 15 JAN), WHICH PRODUCED 33 M-CLASS
FLARES AND 6 X-CLASS FLARES ON ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT IS DUE
TO RETURN ON 03 FEBRUARY AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ACTIVITY
AND BACKGROUND FLUX LEVELS SUBSTANTIALLY AT THAT TIME.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED UNTIL 0600Z WHEN
CONDITIONS BECAME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE. MIDDLE LATITUDES
CONTINUED AT ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY AND
HIGHER LATITUDES ATTAINED MINOR STORM LEVELS FROM APPROXIMATELY
1500-2100Z. THE DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY COMBINED
EFFECTS OF THE SOLAR ACTIVITY WHICH OCCURRED ON 30 JANUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGH
TOMORROW AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE PERSISTS. EFFECTS FROM
TODAY'S M7 FLARE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE SOMEWHAT, BEGINNING LATE
TOMORROW AND LASTING PARTWAY THROUGH THE SECOND DAY. CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED LEVELS THEREAFTER
