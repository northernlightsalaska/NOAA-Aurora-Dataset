FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 321
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 17 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THREE M-CLASS EVENTS
WERE OBSERVED TODAY FROM REGION 5793 (S22W08). THE FIRST WAS
AN M1/1F AT 16/2241Z ACCOMPANIED BY WEAK RADIO BURSTS. THE
SECOND WAS AN M1/2B AT 0800Z ACCOMPANIED BY MODERATE RADIO
BURSTS. THE THIRD WAS AN M1/SF AT 1323Z. REGION 5786 (N13W64),
WHICH PRODUCED MAJOR FLARES ON PREVIOUS DAYS, HAS UNDERGONE
SIGNIFICANT DECAY AND PRODUCED ONLY SUBFLARES DURING THE PERIOD.
NEW REGION 5696 (N12E63) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5786 IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAIN THREAT FOR
ACTIVITY, ALTHOUGH REGIONS 5788 (S21W25) AND 5793 (S22W08) ALSO
SHOW POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING LOW LEVEL M-CLASS FLARES. THERE IS
A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR HIGH LEVELS OF ACTIVITY FROM 5786.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS INITIALLY QUIET BUT ATTAINED MAJOR TO
SEVERE STORM LEVELS AFTER A SUDDEN STORM COMMENCEMENT (SSC)
OCCURRED AT 0925UT. THE SSC MEASURED 72 GAMMAS IN BOULDER.
NUMEROUS MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSINGS WERE OBSERVED AT GEOSTATIONARY
ORBIT FROM GOES-7 (W135) AND GOES-6 (W098) DURING THE STORM,
INCLUDING AN IMPRESSIVE 3 HOUR PERIOD FROM 1500-1800Z WHEN
GOES-7 WAS CONTINUOUSLY OUTSIDE THE MAGNETOSPHERE. THE K-INDEX
DURING THAT PERIOD WAS 7. THE MOST LIKELY SOLAR SOURCE FOR THE
STORM WAS THE X3 FLARE/CORONAL MASS EJECTION EVENT THAT OCCURRED
ON THE 15TH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS
THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE CONTINUES. ISOLATED PERIODS OF SEVERE
STORMING ARE POSSIBLE DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME HOURS AS A RESULT
OF SUBSTORM INJECTIONS. ADDITIONAL INPUT TO THE STORM IS PROB-
ABLE SOMETIME TOMORROW AS A RESULT OF THE X1/CME EVENT OB-
SERVED ON THE 16TH. THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO MINOR
LEVELS ON THE 2ND DAY AND CONDITIONS SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO
ACTIVE BY THE THIRD DAY.
