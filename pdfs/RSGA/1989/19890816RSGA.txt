SDF NUMBER 228
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 16 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5629 (S11W92)
PRODUCED AN ESTIMATED X20/2N FLARE AT 0118Z. THE VALUE FOR THIS
X-RAY EVENT IS ESTIMATED DUE TO DETECTOR SATURATION. THE X20 WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY MAJOR DISCRETE FREQUENCY BURSTS ACROSS THE
SPECTRUM (5400 SFU AT 2695 MHZ) AND A STRONG TYPE IV SWEEP. THIS
LONG DURATION FLARE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 13 HOURS. IN ADDITION
THIS REGION YIELDED AN M4/SF FLARE AT 2148Z. REGIONS 5643
(N17E09) AND 5645 (N28E36) CONTINUED TO SHOW COMPLEXITY AND
DISPLAYED DELTA CONFIGURATIONS. NEW REGION 5648 (N07W20) WAS
NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5629 MAY PRODUCE MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY
AS IT ROTATES OVER THE WEST LIMB. REGIONS 5643 AND 5645 SHOW THE
POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MAJOR AND MINOR STORM LEVELS
OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD. THE POLAR CAP
ABSORPTION AND PROTON EVENTS WERE STILL IN PROGRESS. AN
ENHANCEMENT IN THE PROTON FLUX AND PCA LEVELS WAS OBSERVED
IN THE WAKE OF THE X20 FLARE. A GROUND LEVEL EVENT (GLE) WAS
OBSERVED WITH THE X20 FLARE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGH 17
AUGUST WITH MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS OCCURRING DURING THE
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD DUE TO THE X20 FLARE FROM REGION 5629.
THE POLAR CAP ABSORPTION AND PROTON EVENTS SHOULD CONTINUE
