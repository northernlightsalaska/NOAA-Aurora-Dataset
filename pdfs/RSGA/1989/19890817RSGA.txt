FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 229
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 17 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. ALTHOUGH REGION 5629
IS NOW MORE THAN A DAY BEYOND WEST LIMB AT S16 IT CONTINUES
TO DOMINATE ACTIVITY. IT PRODUCED AN X2 TENFLARE AT 0122Z AND
IS THE LIKELY SITE OF AN M2 WITH ASSOCIATED ERUPTIVE PROM-
INENCE VISIBLE TO .5 SOLAR RADII AT 1924Z. THE MOST RECENT
EVENT INCLUDED A TYPE II SWEEP. OF THE REMAINING DISK REGIONS
5645 (N28E23) AND 5643 (N15W03) ARE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE BUT
NEITHER HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY FLARE-RICH. NEWLY ASSIGNED
REGION 5649 (N29E52) IS WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE TRAILER
SPOTS OF REGION 5647 (N27E48) BUT IS A DISTINCT BIPOLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. RECENT GROWTH IN REGION 5645 MAKES IT THE MOST
LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR CLASS M ACTIVITY. REGION 5643 MAY ALSO
PRODUCE ENERGETIC ACTIVITY AND A FINAL PARTING SHOT FROM
REGION 5629 IS POSSIBLE EARLY ON.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE UNTIL 1541Z
WHEN A NEGATIVE SUDDEN IMPULSE OF ABOUT 57 NANOTESLAS WAS
MEASURED AT BOULDER. ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS HAVE
PREVAILED SINCE. THE POLAR CAP ABSORPTION AND SATELLITE
PROTON EVENTS CONTINUE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS THE NEXT
48 HOURS AS A DISTURBANCE EMANATING FROM YESTERDAY'S X20
FLARE AT WEST LIMB IS DUE. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS SHOULD
PREVAIL 20 AUGUST.
