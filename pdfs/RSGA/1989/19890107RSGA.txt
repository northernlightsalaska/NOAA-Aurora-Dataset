FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 007
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 07 JAN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5312 (S31E64)
PRODUCED TODAY'S LARGEST EVENT, AN X1/1F FLARE AT 0430Z. A
MAGNETIC DELTA CONFIGURATION HAS ROTATED INTO VIEW IN THE
TRAILING PORTION OF THE REGION. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES
OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD: AN M1 AT 2343Z, THREE M1/SF FLARES
FROM REGION 5301 (S18W81) AT 1309Z, 1721Z, AND 1813Z, AND TWO
M1/SF FLARES FROM REGION 5312 AT 1849Z AND 1945Z. THE 10CM
FLUX ROSE DRAMATICALLY TO 248 SFU TODAY, AND THE X-RAY FLUXES
HAVE BEEN ENHANCED ABOVE C3 LEVEL SINCE 06/2100Z AND ABOVE C6
LEVEL SINCE ABOUT 07/1200Z. SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON THE WEST
LIMB ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXIT OF REGIONS 5301 AND 5303 FROM
THE SOLAR DISK. CORONAGRAPH OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT CORONAL
MASS EJECTIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH YESTERDAY'S M8 FLARE AND
TODAY'S X1 FLARE BOTH OF WHICH WERE PRODUCED BY REGION 5312.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5312 IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MAIN SOURCE
OF ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND CONTINUES TO POSE A
SLIGHT THREAT FOR X-CLASS OR PROTON PRODUCING FLARES. REGIONS
5301, 5307 (N30E14) AND 5309 (S18E29) ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF KEEP-
ING ACTIVITY AT MODERATE LEVELS. OLD REGION 5278 (N28, L-275)
IS DUE TO RETURN LATE TOMORROW AND MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLAR
ACTIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS WHEN IT APPEARS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT PREDOMINATELY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED AT APPROXIMATELY 2355Z
ON 06 JANUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAL MASS
EJECTION/SOLAR FLARE ACTIVITY OF THE LAST TWO DAYS. HIGH
LATITUDES MAY EXPERIENCE BRIEF MINOR STORM PERIODS ON THE
SECOND DAY DURING THE PEAK OF THE DISTURBANCE.
