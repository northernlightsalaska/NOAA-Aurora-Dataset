SDF NUMBER 062
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 03 MAR 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. JUST ONE M-CLASS
EVENT OCCURRED AND IT WAS AN M1 AT 0929Z. IT CORRELATED WITH A
SPRAY VISIBLE TO .47 SOLAR RADII WHICH ORIGINATED NEAR THE SITE
OF REGION 5378, NOW A DAY BEYOND WEST LIMB AT N15. THE REST OF
THE VISIBLE DISK WAS UNIMPRESSIVE AS ONLY C-CLASS SUBFLARES
WERE OBSERVED. OLD REGION 5354 (N30, L-283) IS NOW DUE AT EAST
LIMB BUT AS YET HAS NOT BEEN SEEN.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THE
MAJORITY OF THE INTERVAL. HIGH LATITUDES EXPERIENCED SOME
MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS. PARTICLE AND MAGNETIC DATA SUGGEST
THE DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE STEMMED FROM A HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND
STREAM. THERE IS A SMALL EQUATORIAL CORONAL HOLE NOW LOCATED
NEAR W30.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT 48 HOURS. STRICTLY
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL 06 MARCH.
