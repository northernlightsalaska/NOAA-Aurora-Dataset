FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 250
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 07 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5669 (S18W36)
PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 07/0536Z, AN M1/1B AT 07/0829Z WITH A 10CM
BURST OF 290 F.U., AND AN M1/1B AT 07/1537Z. SOME OF THE TRAILER
AND INTERMEDIATE SPOTS IN REGION 5669 APPEAR TO BE FRAGMENTING
WHICH INDICATES THE BEGINNING OF A DECAY PHASE. HOWEVER,
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AND STRONG GRADIENTS REMAIN. REGION 5672
(N24W09) SEEMED TO HAVE STABILIZED AT A MODERATE SIZE CLASS E
GROUP WITH A WEAK DELTA CONFIGURATION. REGION 5680 (N16E52)
ALSO SHOWED ITSELF AS A MODERATE SIZE CLASS E GROUP BUT ITS
EVOLUTION IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AT THIS TIME. NEW REGION
5687 (N14E78) ROTATED OVER THE LIMB AS A SMALL TO MODERATE SIZE
CLASS D GROUP. THIS REGION IS IN THE AREA WHERE OLD REGION 5643
WAS DUE TO RETURN.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A MODERATE LEVEL. REGION 5669 IS STILL CAPABLE OF
PRODUCING HIGH CLASS M AND CLASS X FLARES DURING ITS DECAY.
THE OTHER REGIONS MENTIONED ABOVE ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
ISOLATED CLASS M FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED UNTIL A
SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 30 GAMMA WAS OBSERVED AT 07/1651Z. MINOR
STORM LEVELS FOLLOWED THE SUDDEN IMPULSE. THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCES FOR THIS DISTURBANCE ARE MID LEVEL CLASS M FLARES
OBSERVED LATE ON 05 SEP.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  GENERALLY ACTIVE
GEOMAGNETIC CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
PERIODS AT MINOR STORM LEVELS ARE LIKELY, ESPECIALLY ON
08 SEP. A PROTON EVENT AND PCA FROM A FLARE IN REGION 5669
REMAINS A POSSIBILITY DURING THE PERIOD.
III.  EVENT PROBABILITIES 08 SEP-10 SEP
CLASS M    90/90/90
CLASS X    45/45/45
PROTON     25/25/25
PCAF       YELLOW
IV.  OTTAWA 10.7 CM FLUX
OBSERVED           07 SEP  305
PREDICTED   08 SEP-10 SEP  309/309/305
90 DAY MEAN        07 SEP  218
V.  GEOMAGNETIC A INDICES
OBSERVED  AFR/AP 06 SEP  011/015
ESTIMATED AFR/AP 07 SEP  019/020
PREDICTED AFR/AP 08 SEP-10 SEP  025/025-018/020-015/018
