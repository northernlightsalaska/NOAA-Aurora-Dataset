FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 357
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 23 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5854 (N23E65) PRO-
DUCED AN M5/SF FLARE AT 22/2308Z. THE EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
LOOPS AND MODEST RADIO BURSTS AT THE HIGHER FREQUENCIES (2695-
15400 MHZ). REGION 5854 IS NOW THE LARGEST SUNSPOT GROUP ON THE
SOLAR DISK (590 MILLIONTHS). ADDITIONAL M-CLASS EVENTS OCCURRED
WITHOUT OPTICAL ASSOCIATIONS AT 0125Z, 0144Z, AND 0219Z, DURING
A PERIOD OF GENERALLY ENHANCED X-RAY FLUX LEVELS FROM 0130-
0230UT. THE REST OF THE DAY WAS CHARACTERIZED BY UPPER LEVEL
C-CLASS FLARES MOSTLY FROM 5854 BUT ALSO FROM 5853 (S09E61).
THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL SPOTS ROTATING INTO VIEW TO THE EAST
OF 5853, BUT PROXIMITY TO LIMB PREVENTED ATTEMPTS TO DISTINGUISH
A SEPARATE REGION AT THIS TIME.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5854 IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE
FOR M-CLASS EVENTS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY FROM REGION 5854.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED, WITH A
PERIOD OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS FROM ABOUT 0300-1200Z. THE DIS-
TURBED PERIOD APPEARS TO BE RESIDUAL FROM YESTERDAY'S ACTIVE
TO STORM LEVEL ACTIVITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
