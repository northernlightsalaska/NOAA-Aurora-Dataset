FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 182
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 01 JUL 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. FLARE ACTIVITY WAS
REMARKABLY REDUCED DURING THE PERIOD WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL
SUBFLARES ALL OF WHICH WERE X-RAY CLASS C1 OR LESS. REGION
5569 (N21W39) IN PARTICULAR EXHIBITED STEADY, QUIET DECAY
AND SIMPLIFICATION. MINOR SURGE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED ON
WEST LIMB AT N20 AND EAST LIMB AT N08. THE REMAINDER OF
THE DISK WAS QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 5569 IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY
THREAT FOR M-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED FROM THE BEGIN-
NING OF THE DAY UNTIL SHORTLY AFTER 1500Z WHEN THE CONDITIONS
ATTAINED ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS. THE FIRST INDICATION
OF ACTIVITY WAS A SUDDEN IMPULSE AT ABOUT 0730Z. THE BOULDER
MAGNETOMETER RECORDED A 34 NANOTESLA JUMP AT THAT TIME. THE
DISTURBANCE WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY THE M3/2B FLARE WHICH
OCCURRED AT 29/2127Z. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PARTICLE CHAN-
NELS ALSO RECORDED PERIODS OF ENHANCED FLUXES DURING THE
PERIOD AND ATTAINED EVENT LEVEL FROM 0655-1030Z WITH A PEAK
FLUX OF 17 PFU AT 0720Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE WITH PERIODS OF STORM CONDITIONS TOMOR-
ROW AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE PERSISTS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ON THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS DUE TO
EFFECTS FROM A HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND STREAM WHICH IS EXPECTED
TO IMPACT THE EARTH AT THAT TIME. EVIDENCE FOR THE STREAM IN-
CLUDES A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE (L=220, S30-S45),
PIONEER-VENUS SOLAR WIND DATA, AND RECURRENCE.
