SDF NUMBER 252
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 09 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5669 (S18W61)
PRODUCED AN X1/1F TENFLARE AT 1934Z. IT WAS ALSO THE SITE OF AN
M1/1N AT 08/2140Z AND AN M1/0F AT 0444Z. SLOW DECAY CONTINUES
IN THE REGION. REGION 5680 (N16E26) YIELDED AN X-CLASS FLARE
OF ITS OWN, AN X1/2B TENFLARE WITH TYPE II AND TYPE IV SWEEP
AT 0914Z. THAT REGION HAD OTHER FLARES INCLUDING AN M1/1N WITH
TYPE II AT 0523Z AND AN M1/1N AT 1854Z. REGION 5680 HAS GROWN
IN BOTH WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA DURING THE INTERVAL. NUMEROUS
C-CLASS FLARES WERE GENERATED BY A VARIETY OF REGIONS, MOST
OF WHICH ARE POSITIONED IN THE BUSY NORTHEAST QUADRANT. NEWLY
ASSIGNED REGION 5690 (N21E65) IS A MATURE BUT SIMPLE SPOT
GROUP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT EITHER
REGION 5669 OR 5680 WILL ABATE ITS FLARE PRODUCTION. EXPECT
OCCASIONAL X-CLASS ACTIVITY FROM THOSE SITES AS WELL AS
A NUMBER OF M-CLASS FLARES IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT TWO DAYS. ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR 12 SEPTEMBER DUE
TO TODAY'S ENERGETIC FLARE ACTIVITY.
