TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 5303 (S18W72)
PRODUCED BUT TWO C-CLASS SUBFLARES SINCE YESTERDAY'S M4/1N

ROTATED ONTO THE DISK. NEAR CONTINUOUS SURGING WAS SEEN IN THAT
VICINITY, AND IT WAS ALSO REPORTED NEAR NE30.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5303 STILL APPEARS TO BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR
M-CLASS ACTIVITY AND THE REGION ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB MAY ALSO
PARTICIPATE.
