FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 206
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 25 JUL 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  AN X2/2N FLARE OCCURRED
AT 25/0844UT FROM REGION 5603 (N28W90).  THIS WAS A RELATIVELY
IMPULSIVE EVENT BUT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG TYPE II AND IV
SWEEP AND SMALL DISCREET BURSTS.  PROTONS WERE OBSERVED AT EARTH
WITHIN 20 MINUTES OF THE START OF THE FLARE.  REGION 5603 IS NOW
BEYOND THE WEST LIMB, BUT HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE PRODUCING SMALL
C LEVEL FLARES AND BRIGHT SURGES.  OTHER REGIONS OF INTEREST
INCLUDE REGIONS 5597 (S13W56) AND 5598 (S22W42).  REGION 5598 IS
GROWING AND HAS SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.  THE EASTERN HEMI-
SPHERE IS NEARLY VOID OF SPOTS AND THE EAST LIMB IS QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  THERE IS A CHANCE FOR ANOTHER ENERGETIC EVENT
FROM REGION 5603.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE REGION IS BEYOND THE WEST
LIMB OF THE SUN, REGION AND ANY SUBSEQUENT FLARE MEASUREMENTS
WILL BE LIMITED.  ISOLATED CLASS M FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM
REGIONS 5597 AND 5598.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  A SMALL BUT ENERGETIC PROTON
EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE X2 FLARE MENTIONED IN PART 1A,
BEGAN AT 25/0900UT.  THIS EVENT RESULTED IN A SMALL
ENHANCEMENT ON THE THULE NEUTRON MONITOR, THE FIRST NOTABLE
GROUND LEVEL ENHANCEMENT THIS SOLAR CYCLE.  P10 PEAK FLUX
WAS 54 PFU AT 25/1225UT.  PARTICLE FLUXES ARE NOW DECLINING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CORONAL
HOLE LOCATED NEAR N30W40.  THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN
INCREASE IN ACTIVITY LATE IN THE PERIOD FROM THE X2 FLARE.
