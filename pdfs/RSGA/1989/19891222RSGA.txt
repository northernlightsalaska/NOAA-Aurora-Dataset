FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 356
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 22 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S ACTIVITY WAS CHAR-
ACTERIZED BY OCCASIONAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES. A MARKED RISE IN
X-RAY BACKGROUND LEVELS WAS NOTED AT ABOUT 16Z, AND APPEARS TO
BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL NEW SUNSPOT
GROUPS. A TOTAL OF SEVEN NEW REGION ASSIGNMENTS WERE MADE TODAY,
WITH THREE OF THE NEW REGIONS EMERGING ON THE DISK AND FOUR OF
THEM ROTATING INTO VIEW. AMONG THESE, REGIONS 5853 (S10E70),
5854 (N23E78) AND 5857 (S15E80) SHOW SOME MATURE SPOTS. REGION
5854 IN PARTICULAR SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY DYNAMIC AS IT CONTINUED
TO SHOW SURGE ACTIVITY ON THE LIMB THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE MAIN REGIONS THAT APPEAR TO BE CAPABLE OF M-CLASS
FLARES ARE 5837 (N19W30), WHICH SHOWS SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY,
AND 5854. THE INCREASE OF BACKGROUND LEVELS AND NEW FLUX
EMERGENCE ALSO SUGGESTS A GENERAL UPWARD TREND IN SOLAR
ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO STORM LEVELS DURING
THE PERIOD. QUIET TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS PREDOMINATED UNTIL
ABOUT 12Z WHEN DISTURBED CONDITIONS BEGAN. SINCE THEN MIDDLE
LATITUDES HAVE BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS AND THE
HIGHER LATITUDES HAVE BEEN AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.
THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THE DISTURBANCE APPEARS TO BE A
FAVORABLY LOCATED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
ISOLATED PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS MAY PERSIST EARLY ON THE
FIRST DAY AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE SUBSIDES.
