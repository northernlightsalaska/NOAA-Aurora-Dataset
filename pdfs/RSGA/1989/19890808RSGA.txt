SDF NUMBER 220
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 08 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5629 (S18E07)
PRODUCED AN M3/SF FLARE AT 08/0520Z. THE REGION ALSO PRODUCED A
MULTITUDE OF SUBFLARES, INCLUDING TWO C-CLASS FLARES. 5629
REMAINED THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLEX REGION ON THE DISK. REGION
5622 (S26W51) GREW DURING THE PERIOD AND DEVELOPED A DELTA
MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION WITHIN ITS LEADER SPOTS, BUT WAS QUIET
DURING THE DAY. REGION 5633 (S27E14) ALSO GREW DURING THE PERIOD
AND PRODUCED AN M1/1N FLARE AT 07/2143Z. THREE NEW REGIONS WERE
NUMBERED: 5637 (N26E57), 5638 (S20W43), AND 5639 (N28E81). ALL
THREE REGIONS WERE MORPHOLOGICALLY UNIMPRESSIVE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 5622, 5629, AND 5633 ARE THE PRIMARY THREATS
FOR M-FLARE PRODUCTION. REGIONS 5622 AND 5629 ARE CAPABLE OF
ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
