FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 010
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 10 JAN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5312 (S31E28)
CONTINUED TO DOMINATE THE SOLAR DISK AND PRODUCED THE DAY'S
LARGEST EVENT, AN X1/1B FLARE WHICH OCCURRED AT 2031Z AND WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY OUTSTANDING DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS WITH A
CASTELLI-U SIGNATURE AND BY A MODERATE TYPE II RADIO SWEEP
WITH ESTIMATED SHOCK VELOCITY AT 1000 KM/S. THIS REGION
CONTINUES TO GROW IN AREA WITH ITS FKC BETA-GAMMA-DELTA
CLASSIFICATION, EXHIBITING STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS AND
GRADIENTS. THE REGION PRODUCED ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES
DURING THE PERIOD: AN M3/1N AT 0034Z, AN M3/SN AT 0628Z,
AND AN M2/SN AT 1759Z. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES OCCURRED:
M1/1F FROM REGION 5316 (S32E56), AN UNASSOCIATED M1 AT 1312Z,
AND AN M1/SF FROM 5315 (N35W03). FOUR NEW REGIONS ROTATED INTO
VIEW: 5317 (N20E65), 5318 (N27E68), 5319 (S19E53), AND 5320
(S19E76). SURGING CONTINUED ON THE EAST LIMB AT N20.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. REGION 5312 IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF
ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE
ADDITIONAL CLASS M5 OR LARGER FLARES. THE LIKELIHOOD OF
PROTON PRODUCING FLARES WILL INCREASE AS THE REGION MOVES
TO MORE WESTERLY LONGITUDES. REGION 5311 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE
SOME M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. SOME
BRIEF ACTIVE PERIODS OCCURRED AT HIGHER LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE IN RESPONSE TO THE SOLAR
FLARE EFFECTS OF THE PREVIOUS FEW DAYS. THERE IS A SLIGHT
CHANCE THAT TODAY'S X-CLASS SOLAR FLARE WILL ENHANCE THE
GREATER THAN 10 MEV ENERGETIC PARTICLE FLUXES.
