CONTINUED MAJOR FLARE PRODUCTION. THE LARGEST REACHED M7/2B

PRODUCTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
THIS DISTURBANCE MAY BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE X15 FLARE OF
6 MAR 89. THE 10 MEV PROTON EVENT CONTINUED IN PROGRESS
WITH A PEAK OF 440 PFU VERY LATE IN THE PERIOD. THIS WAS
PROBABLY THE CONTRIBUTORY ACCUMULATION OF THE X4/3B FLARE

INITIALLY STARTED 08/1735Z. THE PCA EVENT ALSO CONTINUED IN
PROGRESS AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. IT ALSO PEAKED OUT WITH
A 4.8 DB LEVEL VERY LATE IN THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR STORM TO ACTIVE LEVELS. THE X4/3B FLARE
