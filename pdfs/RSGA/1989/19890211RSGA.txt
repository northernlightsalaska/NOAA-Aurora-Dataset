SDF NUMBER 042
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 11 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5355 (N22E07)
PRODUCED A LONG-DURATION M2/2N FLARE AT 11/1221Z. NO SIGNIFICANT
RADIO EMISSIONS WERE DETECTED DURING THE FLARE. REGION 5354
(N31W10) MAINTAINED ITS COMPLEX MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION, BUT WAS
RELATIVELY QUIET DURING THE ANALYSIS PERIOD. TWO NEW REGIONS
WERE NUMBERED: 5361 (S16W50), A SMALL UNIPOLE, AND 5362
(N18E71), A D-TYPE GROUP WHOSE PROXIMITY TO THE LIMB PREVENTS A
DETAILED STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5354 AND 5355 ARE CAPABLE OF MAJOR
FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HOWEVER, ISOLATED PERIODS OF ACTIVE
LEVELS OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. PERIODS OF MINOR
STORMING ARE POSSIBLE ON 13 FEBRUARY DUE TO THE X1/3B FLARE
THAT OCCURRED ON THE 10TH.
