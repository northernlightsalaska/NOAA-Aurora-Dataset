FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 009
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 09 JAN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5312 (S31E42)
DOMINATED SOLAR ACTIVITY WITH CONTINUED GROWTH, MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY AND FLARE PRODUCTION. THE REGION PRODUCED THE DAY'S
LARGEST EVENT, AN M8/1B FLARE AT 1926Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
A TENFLARE AND FLARE LOOPS. THE REGION PRODUCED TWO ADDITIONAL
M-CLASS FLARES: AN M4/SN AT 2348Z AND AN M2/SN AT 0509Z. REGION
5311 (S14E18) ALSO EXHIBITED GROWTH AND BRIGHT PLAGE FOR MOST
OF THE DAY WITH A WEAK DELTA CONFIGURATION IN THE TRAILER AREA
AND PRODUCED AN M2/SF AT 0715Z. THE REGION APPEARED TO BE WEAK-
ENING NEAR THE END OF THE DAY. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES FOLLOW:
AN M3/2N FROM SPOTLESS REGION 5315 (N29E04), AN M1/SF FROM THE
SURGE REGION ON THE EAST LIMB AT N19, AND AN UNASSOCIATED M1
AT 1409Z. X-RAY FLUX LEVELS AND 10CM FLUX CONTINUE TO BE
ELEVATED ALTHOUGH NOT AS HIGH AS YESTERDAY, PROBABLY BECAUSE
OF THE EXIT OF REGION 5301 (S18) AROUND THE WEST LIMB. EAST
LIMB CORONAL ACTIVITY CONTINUED TO BE IMPRESSIVE AND SURGING
CONTINUES AT S34, N20, AND N30. A NEW GROUP 5316 (S32E67)
ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY WHICH WAS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
S34 SURGE ACTIVITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. REGION 5312 IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF
ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WILL PROBABLY PRODUCE
ADDITIONAL CLASS M5 OR LARGER FLARES. AS THE REGION MOVES ACROSS
THE DISK, THE PROBABILITY OF A PROTON PRODUCING FLARE INCREASES.
REGION 5311 IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY,
AND REGIONS 5305 (N11W25) AND 5307 (N28W11) POSE A SLIGHT THREAT
FOR ADDITIONAL M-FLARES AS WELL. BECAUSE OF THE CORONAL ACTIVITY
AND SURGE ACTIVITY ON THE EAST LIMB IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE
LONGITUDES WHICH ROTATE INTO VIEW OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS WILL
ENHANCE SOLAR ACTIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. THE
DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SOLAR FLARE/CORONAL
MASS EJECTION ACTIVITY WHICH OCCURRED LATE ON THE 6TH AND
EARLY ON THE 7TH OR BY A CORONAL HOLE OBSERVED YESTERDAY
TO BE CENTERED AT ABOUT N27W35.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT SOLAR FLARE AND CORONAL
MASS EJECTION ACTIVITY.
