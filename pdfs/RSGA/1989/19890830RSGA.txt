MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5669 IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES. X-CLASS ACTIVITY MAY ALSO OCCUR FROM THIS REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE HIGH LATITUDE
FIELD RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM LEVELS. THE HIGH
LATITUDE STORMING OCCURRED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE
PERIOD. THE CAUSE OF THE STORMING REMAINS A MYSTERY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES WHILE
THE HIGH LATITUDE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO
UNSETTLED LEVELS.
