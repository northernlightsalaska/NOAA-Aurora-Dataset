FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 034
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 03 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. A LONG DURATION
ENHANCEMENT OF THE X-RAY EMISSION OCCURRED FROM 1355-1757Z: THE
EVENT HAD A SOMEWHAT GRADUAL RISE, TWO PEAKS (M3 AT 1436Z AND
M1 AT 1626Z), AND A SLOW DECLINE. SUBFLARE MAXIMUMS OBSERVED
IN THIS TIME WINDOW WERE PRODUCED BY REGION 5336 (S20W93) AT
1416Z AND BY REGION 5330 (N19W80) AT 1545Z, NEITHER OF WHICH
CORRESPONDS WELL WITH THE X-RAY MAXIMA. IT SEEMS LIKELY, THERE-
FORE, THAT THE SIGNATURE INDICATES A SIGNIFICANT SOLAR EVENT
BEHIND THE LIMB. FOUR NEW SUNSPOT GROUPS EMERGED ON THE DISK
TODAY AND NEW REGION 5353 (S29E84) ROTATED INTO VIEW AS THE
RETURN OF OLD REGION 5312. OBSERVATIONS AT THIS TIME INDICATE
5353 IS A BI-POLAR D-TYPE SUNSPOT GROUP. CORONAL RAIN WAS
OBSERVED ON THE EAST LIMB AT N32.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR M-CLASS FLARES ARE
CONSIDERED TO BE FROM BEHIND THE EAST LIMB (BECAUSE OF TODAY'S
EVENT), REGION 5334 (S21W22) AND REGION 5353 (S29E84).
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. CONDITIONS WERE INITIALLY ACTIVE BUT INTENSIFIED TO
A MINOR STORM AT ABOUT 03/0100Z AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A
FEW BRIEF ACTIVE PERIODS, REMAINDED AT THAT LEVEL ALL DAY.
A MAJOR STORM PERIOD AT HIGH LATITUDES OCCURRED BETWEEN
1200-1800Z. THE DISTURBANCE WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE
FILAMENT THAT DISAPPEARED ON 01 JANUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGH
TOMORROW. MOSTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON THE SECOND
AND THIRD DAYS IN RESPONSE TO A CORONAL HOLE WHICH WILL BE
FAVORABLY POSITIONED AT THAT TIME.
