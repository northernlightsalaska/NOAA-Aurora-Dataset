SDF NUMBER 273  ::::::::::CORRECTED COPY::::::::::
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 30 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5712 (S18E29)
PRODUCED AN M2/2N FLARE AT 30/0259Z WITH A MINOR 10CM BURST OF
66 FLUX UNITS. THIS REGION GREW SLOWLY AND SOME PROPER MOTION OF
AN INTERIOR ISOLATED POLE WAS OBSERVED. REGION 5714 (N27E59) MAY
CONSIST OF TWO STACKED REGIONS. HOWEVER, THEIR SHARED NEUTRAL
LINE AND THE H-ALPHA PLAGE STRUCTURE ARGUE FOR ONE COMPLEX. THE
WEST LIMB NEAR S26 WAS QUIET WHERE REGION 5698 ROTATED OVER.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A MODERATE LEVEL. REGION 5712 IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ONE
OR MORE CLASS M FLARES PER DAY. AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE IS
POSSIBLE FROM THIS AREA. OLD REGION 5697 (N28, L-352) WILL
RETURN TO THE EAST LIMB ON 02 OCT. LAST ROTATION THIS REGION
GREW RAPIDLY PRIOR TO WEST LIMB TRANSIT AND MAY INCREASE
ACTIVITY LEVELS UPON ITS RETURN.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET FOR THE EARLY PART OF
THE PERIOD AND BECAME SLIGHTLY ACTIVE AFTER A SMALL SUDDEN
IMPULSE OF 8 GAMMA WAS OBSERVED AT 30/1715Z. THE MAJOR
PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN AT 29/1210Z (ENERGIES GT 10MEV)
REACHED A MAXIMUM FLUX OF 4500 P.F.U. AT 30/0210Z. THE
GREATER THAN 100MEV FLUX WHICH EXCEEDED 100 P.F.U. AT
29/1320Z REACHED MAXIMUM OF 310 P.F.U. AT 29/2000Z AND
DECAYED BELOW 100 P.F.U. AT 30/1035Z. AT 30/2100Z THE
GT 10MEV FLUX WAS 2600 P.F.U. AND THE GT 100MEV FLUX WAS
34 P.F.U.  THE POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT CONTINUES.
RECORDS INDICATE THAT THIS PROTON EVENT PRODUCED THE HIGHEST
INTENSITY GROUND LEVEL EVENT IN OVER 30 YEARS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD CONTINUE SLIGHTLY ACTIVE FOR 01 OCT. MINOR TO MAJOR
STORM CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR 02-03 OCT AS A RESULT OF
THE X9 FLARE ON 29 SEP. THE GT 10 MEV PROTON EVENT AND PCA
SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY DECAY DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.
