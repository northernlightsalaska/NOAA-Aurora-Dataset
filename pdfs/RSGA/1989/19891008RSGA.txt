IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE ONLY NOTABLE X-RAY
EVENT DURING THE PERIOD WAS A C3.9/SF FROM REGION 5728

PRODUCED BY REGIONS 5721 (N27E02) AND 5728. AN ERUPTIVE
PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED ON THE EAST LIMB AT N43 FROM 07/2353Z -
08/0208Z AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP
AND A CORONAL MASS EJECTION OF AVERAGE SPEED. THE REMAINDER
OF THE DISK WAS GENERALLY STABLE AND DECLINING. SURGING WAS
REPORTED ON THE EAST LIMB AT N26.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW. THERE IS A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
EVENT, WITH REGION 5721 BEING THE MAIN THREAT.

EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
