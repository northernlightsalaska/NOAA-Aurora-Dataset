FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 244
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 01 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5671 (S19E47)
PRODUCED AN X2/SB FLARE AT 01/0820Z. A 360 SFU TENFLARE WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FLARE. THIS VERY LARGE, EXTREMELY COMPLEX
REGION ALSO PRODUCED A SN FLARE AT 01/0614Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH FLARE LOOPS AND A 3000 SFU TENFLARE, BUT NO ACCOMPANYING
X-RAY BURST. IN ADDITION, THE REGION PRODUCED A SF FLARE AT
01/1127Z ACCOMPANIED BY A 13000 SFU BURST AT 245 MHZ. THIS EVENT
ALSO HAD NO APPARENT X-RAY CORRELATION. AN M1/SF FLARE AT
01/1543Z ALSO ORIGINATED WITHIN THIS REGION. REGION 5669
(S15E33) PRODUCED AN M2/1N FLARE AT 01/1501Z AND WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH A 270 SFU TENFLARE AND A 140000 SFU BURST AT 245 MHZ. THIS
REGION IS ALSO VERY LARGE AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. IT IS DUE
WEST OF REGION 5671. TOGETHER, THESE TWO REGIONS FORM QUITE AN
IMPRESSIVE COMPLEX. SOME OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT THIS COMPLEX
MAY ACTUALLY BE ONE LARGE REGION. A LONG-DURATION X-RAY BURST
BEGAN AT 0404Z, REACHED A MAXIMUM OF M4 AT 01/0712Z, AND ENDED
AT 01/1121Z. THERE WAS NO OPTICAL CORRELATION FOR THIS EVENT.
NEW REGIONS 5672 (N24E72) AND 5673 (N23E19) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. M-FLARES AND AN ISOLATED X-FLARE ARE LIKELY
TO OCCUR FROM WITHIN THE 5669/5671 COMPLEX.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND ACTIVE AT
HIGH LATITUDES.
