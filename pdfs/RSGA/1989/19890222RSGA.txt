FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 053
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 22 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5368 (S12W39) WAS
AGAIN THE FOCUS OF ACTIVITY AS IT PRODUCED FOUR M-CLASS FLARES
WITH THE LARGEST AN M7/0B AT 21/2358Z. A COMMON CHARACTERISTIC
OF ALL THE FLARES WAS THE VERY SMALL OUTPUT OVER THE RADIO
SPECTRUM. THE PLAGE IN THE REGION WAS ENHANCED MOST OF THE DAY,
BUT IN WHITE LIGHT THE GROUP SHOWED SLIGHT DECAY. IT IS STILL
MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX BUT LESS SO THAN YESTERDAY. ELSEWHERE, THE
OTHER DISK REGIONS WERE GENERALLY QUIET AND STABLE. SURGING WAS
NOTED AT VARIOUS SITES ON THE EAST LIMB WHERE THREE NEW REGIONS
MAY BE ROTATING INTO VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. REGION 5368 SHOWS NO
SIGNS OF ABATING ITS FLARE PRODUCTION AND M-CLASS ACTIVITY
SHOULD CONTINUE. X-CLASS FLARES ARE NOT ANTICIPATED, BUT IF
THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT, AN ISOLATED EVENT MAY OCCUR.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED. AN EPISODE OF
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WAS OBSERVED MIDWAY THROUGH
THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THROUGH 25 FEBRUARY.
