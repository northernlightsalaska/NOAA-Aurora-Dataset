FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 259
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 16 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5687 (N18W39)
PRODUCED A LONG DURATION M2/1F AT 2334Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY A TYPE II AND A TYPE IV RADIO SWEEP. AN ADDITIONAL M-CLASS
EVENT OCCURRED DURING THE DAY: AN M1/1F FROM 5683 (N17W82)
AT 1632Z. A NEW MATURE REGION ROTATED INTO VIEW AT S25E63 AND
WAS ASSIGNED 5698 BUT WAS RELATIVELY STABLE. THE REMAINDER OF
THE PERIOD CONSISTED OF OCCASIONAL SMALL C-CLASS SUBFLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 5686 (N16W45), 5687, 5694 (N25E03)
APPEAR TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR M-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS INITIALLY AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS WITH SOME PERIODS OF MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS AT HIGH
LATITUDES. THE DISTURBANCE SUBSIDED BETWEEN 1000-1100Z AND
CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED SINCE THEN.
THE DISTURBANCE WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE LONG DURATION
X-RAY EVENT THAT OCCURRED ON 12 SEPTEMBER. THE GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTONS WERE ENHANCED FROM 0400-1700Z BUT DID NOT
ATTAIN EVENT LEVEL. THIS ENHANCEMENT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY
THE LONG DURATION M2 EVENT MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. ACTIVITY LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ELEVATED SOMEWHAT
ON THE SECOND AND POSSIBLY ON THE THIRD DAYS IN RESPONSE TO
TODAY'S LONG DURATION EVENT. PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING ARE
POSSIBLE AT HIGHER LATITUDES.
