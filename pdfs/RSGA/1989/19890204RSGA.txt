FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 035
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 04 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. NEW REGION 5354 (N30E75)
PRODUCED AN X1 FLARE AT 1017Z WITH FAIRLY STRONG DISCRETE RADIO
BURSTS, A STRONG TYPE II SWEEP AND A MODERATE TYPE IV SWEEP. THE
EVENT ROSE RAPIDLY BUT DECAYED SLOWLY, RESULTING IN A LONG DURA-
TION OF 171 MINUTES. OPTICAL OBSERVATORIES REPORTED SPECTACULAR
LOOPS ON THE EAST LIMB WHICH WERE VERY BRIGHT DURING THE EVENT
AND CONTINUED TO BE VISIBLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. CORONAL OBSERVA-
TIONS BY SMM INDICATED THAT A LARGE, FAST MOVING MASS EJECTION
OCCURRED ON THE NORTHEAST LIMB BEGINNING AT 1014Z, JUST BEFORE
X-RAY MAXIMUM. REGION 5354 ALSO PRODUCED A C9 FLARE AT 0022Z
WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SPRAY ACTIVITY OUT TO .16 RADII AND
A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP. REGION 5353 (S30E69) ROTATED MORE
FULLY INTO VIEW AS A SMALL, D-TYPE GROUP AND WAS QUIET. REGION
5334 (S22W48) PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARE FLUCTUATIONS BUT
CONTINUES TO DECAY. SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON THE WEST LIMB AT
S20, ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXIT OF REGION 5336, AND ON THE EAST
LIMB AT N30, ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENTRANCE OF REGION 5354.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5354 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES AND
POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR ADDITIONAL X-CLASS OR PROTON PRODUCING
FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY ACTIVE WITH SOME ISOLATED
PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS. THE DISTURBANCE WAS
PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE FILAMENT THAT DISAPPEARED ON 01
FEBRUARY, ALTHOUGH INITIAL EFFECTS FROM A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE MAY HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TOWARD THE LATTER PART
OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS IN RESPONSE
TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE. THE DISTRUBANCE IS
EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY SUBSIDE BY THE THIRD DAY.
