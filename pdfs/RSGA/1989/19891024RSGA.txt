FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 297
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 24 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY RETURNED TO HIGH LEVELS. REGION
5747 (S27W60) PRODUCED A LONG LIVED X5/3B FLARE WHICH REACHED
MAXIMUM AT 24/1831Z. STRONG TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS WERE OBSERVED
AS WAS A BURST OF 9800 FLUX UNITS AT 10CM. AN M6 PRECURSOR
BURST STARTED AT 25/1736Z THEN THE FLARE SPREAD IN AREA AND
INCREASED IN INTENSITY. FORESHORTENING LIMITED ANALYSIS OF
THIS MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX REGION. REGION 5748 (S16W62) CONTINUED
TO GROW AND PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES. SMALL NEW REGION 5761
(S12E58) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANTLY HIGH FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. REGION 5747 SHOULD
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE CLASS M AND CLASS X FLARES. REGION 5748
IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LOW CLASS M FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PRIMARILY UNSETTLED UNTIL A SUDDEN
IMPULSE OF 24 GAMMA WAS OBSERVED AT 24/1856Z. THIS SHOCK IS
ATTRIBUTED TO THE X2 FLARE ON 22/1805Z. THE PROTON EVENT AT
ENERGIES GT 10MEV CONTINUED. THE GT 10MEV FLUX BEGAN THE
PERIOD AT 3000 P.F.U. AND DECAYED TO APPROXIMATELY 350 P.F.U.
AT 24/1830Z. AS A RESULT OF THE X5 FLARE, FLUXES BEGAN TO
RISE AFTER THAT TIME REACHING 2300 P.F.U. AT THE END OF THE
PERIOD. THE GT 100MEV FLUX ALSO BEGAN TO RISE FOLLOWING
THE X5 FLARE AND AT 24/2100Z THE FLUX WAS NEARING THE
100 P.F.U. THRESHOLD. A GROUND LEVEL EVENT OF 80 PERCENT OVER
BACKGROUND WAS OBSERVED. THE PCA CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED
FOLLOWING THE FLARE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR 25 OCT FOLLOWING
THE SUDDEN IMPULSE MENTIONED ABOVE. CONDITIONS SHOULD CALM
SLIGHTLY TO ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM ON 26 OCT. THE FIELD SHOULD
AGAIN GO INTO MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS ON 27 OCT IN
RESPONSE TO THE X5 FLARE AT 24/1831Z. THE GT 100MEV PROTON
EVENT SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH 25 OCT. THE GT 10MEV EVENT AND
PCA SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.
