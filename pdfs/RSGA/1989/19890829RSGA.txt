FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 241
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 29 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE
PERIOD WAS AN M6/SF AT 29/1523Z FROM REGION 5669 (S16E71). THIS
LARGE, MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX GROUP ALSO PRODUCED FOUR ADDITIONAL
M-CLASS FLARES: AN M4/1N AT 29/1309Z, AN M2/SF AT 29/1659Z
(WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 260 SFU TENFLARE), AN M2/1B AT
29/1723Z (ASSOCIATED WITH A 200 SFU TENFLARE), AND AN M1/2B AT
29/1809Z. REGION 5669 WAS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO BE THE RETURN
OF OLD REGION 5629 WHICH PRODUCED 5 X-CLASS FLARES ON IT'S
LAST TRANSIT. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT
REGION 5669 WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES AHEAD OF WHERE OLD
5629 SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M1 OCCURRED
AT 29/0202Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 360 SFU TENFLARE AND A
SIGNIFICANT TYPE II RADIO SWEEP (VELOCITY ESTIMATED AT 1000
KM/SEC.). NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5669 PROVIDES A GOOD CHANCE FOR
M-CLASS FLARES AND A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN X-CLASS FLARE. OLD
REGION 5629 (MENTIONED ABOVE) WILL LIKELY RETURN TOMORROW
FURTHER ENHANCING CHANCES FOR M- AND X-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. SPECIFICALLY, MINOR STORMING
BEGAN NEAR 29/0000Z FOLLOWED BY AN INCREASE TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS FROM 0600-0900Z. THEREAFTER, THE FIELD DECLINED TO
UNSETTLED LEVELS. THE HIGH LATITUDE FIELD ACHIEVED MINOR
STORM LEVELS NEAR 28/2230Z, REACHED SEVERE STORM LEVELS FROM
29/0300-0900Z, THEN DECLINED TO ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. THE CAUSE OF THIS
DISTURBANCE WAS UNKNOWN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND AT
ACTIVE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS AT HIGHER LATITUDES.
