FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 247
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 04 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5669 (S17E02)
PRODUCED AN X1/2B FLARE AT 04/0904Z FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A
SEPARATE M9 BURST FROM THE SAME REGION AT 04/0919Z. THIS DOUBLE
BURST WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 470 F.U. BURST AT 10CM AND A WEAK
TYPE II. REGION 5669 ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/1B AT 03/2343Z, AN
M1/1N AT 04/0635Z, AND AN M1/1N AT 04/1220Z. AN OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED M1 BURST OCCURRED AT 04/0952Z. REGION 5669 REMAINS
VERY LARGE AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. SOME PENUMBRAL DECAY
OCCURRED BUT MAGNETIC SHEAR IS EVIDENT IN THE CENTER OF THE
REGION. REGION 5672 (N24E33) GREW DURING THE PERIOD AND
PRODUCED AN M2/1N FLARE AT 04/1302Z. SEVERAL SMALL REGIONS
EMERGED ON THE DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A GENERALLY HIGH LEVEL FOR THE PERIOD. CONTINUED CLASS M
FLARES AND OCCASIONAL CLASS X FLARES ARE PREDICTED FROM REGION
5669. THE FREQUENCY OF THESE EVENTS MAY BEGIN TO SLOW AS THE
REGION MATURES AND THEN BEGINS A DECAY PHASE. REGION 5672 CAN
PRODUCE ISOLATED CLASS M FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT GENERALLY ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. DURING A BRIEF PERIOD BETWEEN 04/0300-0430Z, MAJOR
STORM CONDITIONS WERE EXPERIENCED AT HIGH LATITUDES. A SUDDEN
IMPULSE OF 45 GAMMA WAS OBSERVED AT 04/0026Z. A WEAK PROTON
EVENT BEGAN NEAR 04/0120Z AND REACHED A PEAK FLUX OF 44 P.F.U.
AT 04/0510Z. THE EVENT WAS NEARLY UNDER THRESHOLD AT ISSUE
TIME. A PCA BEGAN NEAR 04/0330Z (BASED UPON PROTON FLUXES)
AND ENDED DURING THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT GENERALLY ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
ENTIRE PERIOD AS THE RESULTS OF RECENT FLARE ACTIVITY
REACH THE EARTH. BRIEF PERIODS AT MAJOR STORM LEVELS CAN
BE EXPECTED. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR ANOTHER PROTON
EVENT AND PCA DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
