SDF NUMBER 358
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 24 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO TODAY'S ONLY M-
CLASS EVENT: AN M1/1F FROM REGION 5850 (S29W48) AT 1338Z. THIS
REGION DISPLAYED ENHANCED PLAGE AND PRODUCED ADDITIONAL SUB-
FLARES DURING THE DAY AS IT APPEARED TO BE UNDERGOING SLOW
GROWTH. REGION 5854 (N24E54) CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST MOST
COMPLICATED GROUP ON THE DISK WITH AN AREA OF ABOUT 1110 MIL-
LIONTHS, BUT PRODUCED ONLY A COUPLE OF SUBFLARES DURING THE
PERIOD. REGION 5853 (S10E50) ALSO CONTRIBUTED SOME SUBFLARES.
CURRENT OBSERVATIONS SHOW THIS TO BE AN ELONGATED F-TYPE BETA-
GAMMA GROUP. SURGE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED ON EAST LIMB AT N10 AND
S24. THE REMAINDER OF THE SOLAR DISK WAS ESSENTIALLY QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR HIGH LEVELS. THE MAIN THREATS
FOR ACTIVITY ARE REGIONS 5854 AND 5853.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET UNTIL SHORTLY AFTER
0900Z WHEN ACTIVITY BECAME UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE AT
MIDDLE LATITUDES, AND MOSTLY ACTIVE WITH SOME STORM PERIODS
AT HIGHER LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED WITH OCCASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS
FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. A GRADUAL INCREASE IS POSSIBLE LATE
ON THE THIRD DAY AS A RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE SHOULD BE FAVOR-
ABLY POSITIONED AT THAT TIME.
