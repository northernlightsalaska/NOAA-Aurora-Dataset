FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 092
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 02 APR 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M1 OCCURRED AT
02/1540Z. THIS X-RAY BURST WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A BRIGHT SURGE
(TO .22 RV) OBSERVED NEAR N31E90. THE SURGE ACTIVITY AND
ENHANCED YELLOW-LINE EMISSIONS INDICATE THE RETURN OF OLD REGION
5395 (N34, L-257 CLASS/AREA FKC/3600 ON 17 MAR). REGION 5428
(S18E27) REMAINED IN A GROWTH PHASE THROUGH THE PERIOD, BUT
WAS RELATIVELY QUIET DESPITE ITS LARGE SIZE AND COMPLEX
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. TWO NEW REGIONS REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY:
5435 (N24W54) AND 5436 (S27E07); BOTH WERE SMALL BIPOLES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS LIKELY FROM THE NORTHEAST LIMB AS
OLD 5395 REEMERGES. REGION 5428 IS ALSO CAPABLE OF PRODUCING AN
M-CLASS FLARE. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MAJOR FLARE
ACTIVITY FROM EITHER OF THESE REGIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
STORM LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THIS ACTIVITY IS
PROBABLY THE RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF A CORONAL HOLE LOCATED
NEAR NOOW55.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE TOMORROW AS THE CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS
GRADUALLY SUBSIDE. THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD IS EXPECTED TO
BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
