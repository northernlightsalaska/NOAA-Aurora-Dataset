FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 255
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 12 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINS HIGH. REGION 5669, NOW AT
WEST LIMB NEAR S15, PRODUCED A LONG (OVER SIX HOURS) DURATION
X-RAY EVENT OF MAGNITUDE M5. IT REACHED MAXIMUM AT 0814Z. LOOPS
HAVE PERSISTED AT THE SITE OF THE FLARE WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR
THE STILL ELEVATED X-RAY BACKGROUND. THE REGION ALSO YIELDED AN
M2/1N AT 11/2350Z, AND AN M3/0F AT 0519Z WHILE THE LDE WAS IN
PROGRESS BEHIND THE LIMB. REGION 5686 (N16E02) HAD AN M7/2N
FLARE AT 1012Z, ALSO WHILE THE LDE WAS IN PROGRESS. THE DISK
HAS BEEN FAIRLY QUIET SINCE THIS RASH OF ACTIVITY EARLY IN THE
DAY. MOST REGIONS WERE STABLE OR DECAYING. ONE NEW REGION,
5694 (N26E55), WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. WITH THE DEPARTURE OF REGION 5669 FROM THE DISK,
FLARE PROBABILITIES WILL FALL IN KIND. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT
A LARGE FLARE FROM THAT REGION COULD BE FELT NEAR EARTH IF IT
OCCURS IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. OF THE REMAINING REGIONS VISIBLE,
REGIONS 5680 (N16W13), 5683 (N17W27), AND 5686 (N16E02)
OFFER THE MOST PROMISE FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED. ALTHOUGH
CONDITIONS ARE MORE DISTURBED THAN YESTERDAY, ACTIVITY DID
NOT REACH LEVELS PREVIOUSLY FORECAST. A VERY WEAK PROTON
EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV BEGAN AT 1935Z AND THE MAXIMUM
TO THIS POINT IS 13 PFU. THE LONG-DURATION X-RAY EVENT OF
EARLIER TODAY IS THE MOST PROBABLE SOURCE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT MID-LATITUDES. MINOR
STORM TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
THE LONG DURATION FLARE OF EARLIER TODAY IS EXPECTED TO
DISTURB THE FIELD AT THE END OF THE INTERVAL.
