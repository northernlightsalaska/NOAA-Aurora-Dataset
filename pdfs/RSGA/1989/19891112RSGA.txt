FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 316
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 12 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED
X1 FLARE OCCURRED AT 12/0905Z. THE FLARE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
360 SFU TENFLARE,  A 17000 SFU BURST AT 245 MHZ, AND A MAJOR
TYPE II RADIO SWEEP. REGION 5783 (N18W39) SHOWED NO SIGNS OF
DECAY DURING THE PERIOD (CONTRARY TO YESTERDAY'S OBSERVATIONS)
AND REMAINED MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. REGION 5786 (N12E05) PRODUCED
AN M2/2B FLARE AT 12/0916Z ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST DISCRETE
FREQUENCY BURSTS. THIS REGION GREW SLIGHTLY DURING THE PERIOD.
IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER REGION 5788 (S23E45) CAN BE SPLIT
INTO TWO REGIONS DUE TO ITS LIMB PROXIMITY (WHICH COMPLICATES
MAGNETIC ANALYSIS). REGION 5781 (N12W60) GREW SLIGHTLY. NO NEW
REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5783 AND 5788 ARE THE PRIMARY THREATS
FOR M-FLARE PRODUCTION FOLLOWED BY 5786 AND 5781. REGION 5783
IS CAPABLE OF ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED. TODAY'S X1 FLARE IS NOT EXPECTED TO
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD.
