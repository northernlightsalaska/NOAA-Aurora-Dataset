SDF NUMBER 119
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 29 APR 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THREE LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS
FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD, NONE OF WHICH WERE
SIGNIFICANT IN OPTICAL OR RADIO CHARACTERISTICS. REGION 5454
(S21W85) WAS FAIRLY QUIET AS IT BEGAN TRANSITING THE WEST LIMB.
REGION 5464 (S18E20) GREW SLIGHTLY WHILE MAINTAINING A
MODERATELY COMPLEX MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. NEW REGION 5470 (N29E73)
ROTATED ACROSS THE EAST LIMB AS A SMALL UNIPOLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY LOW. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE FROM REGION 5464 AND A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARE FROM REGIONS 5454 AND 5460 (S18W57).
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. A BRIEF
PERIOD OF MINOR STORM LEVELS OCCURRED NEAR 29/0600Z. THE
HIGH LATITUDE FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
THIS ACTIVITY IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF A CORONAL
HOLE LOCATED NEAR N07W63.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE BASED UPON THE RECURRENT PATTERN.
