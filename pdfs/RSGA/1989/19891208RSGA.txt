SDF NUMBER 342
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 08 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5822 (S11W93)
PRODUCED THE ONLY M-CLASS EVENT OF THE PERIOD: AN M4/1B FLARE
AT 07/2114Z. FLARE LOOPS TO 0.03RV WERE OBSERVED IN THE WAKE OF
THE EVENT. NUMEROUS SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED FROM A VARIETY OF
REGIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE WAS A C6/SF AT 08/1900Z
FROM REGION 5810 (NW26) AS IT CROSSED THE WEST LIMB. A BRIGHT
SURGE TO 0.22RV WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FLARE. REGION 5821
(N20W08) INCREASED IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. NO NEW
REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5821 HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR M-FLARE PRODUCTION,
ESPECIALLY IF IT CONTINUES ITS PRESENT RATE OF EVOLUTION.
REGION 5817 (N13W58) PROVIDES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
M-FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED.
