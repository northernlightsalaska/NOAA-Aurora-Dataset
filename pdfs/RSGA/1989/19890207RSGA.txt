FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 038
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 07 FEB 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5354 (N32E42)
REMAINED MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. IT PRODUCED NUMEROUS FLARES
INCLUDING A VERY IMPULSIVE M2/1B AT 07/1640Z. ALL FLARES
ATTRIBUTED TO THIS REGION HAVE BEEN VERY WEAK IN RADIO ASPECTS.
AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M1 OCCURRED AT 07/0216Z ACCOMPANIED BY
MINOR DISCRETE FREQUENCY RADIO BURSTS IN THE UPPER HALF OF THE
SPECTRUM. INTENSE CALCIUM XV EMISSION WAS OBSERVED FROM 12 TO
40 DEGREES NORTH ON THE EAST LIMB PEAKING AT ABOUT 34 DEGREES
NORTH. TWO FILAMENTS DISAPPEARED DURING THE PERIOD: A 25 DEGREE
FILAMENT FORMERLY LOCATED AT N25E28 AND A 16 DEGREE FILAMENT
THAT WAS LOCATED AT N37W03. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED DURING
THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE FOR AN M-CLASS FLARE
AND A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN X-CLASS FLARE FROM REGION 5354.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. BRIEF PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING
WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES. THIS ACTIVITY WAS PROBABLY
DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF A CORONAL HOLE PRESENTLY CENTERED NEAR
N11W72.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE TOMORROW FOLLOWED BY TWO DAYS OF
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS. TOMORROW'S ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED IN
RESPONSE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
