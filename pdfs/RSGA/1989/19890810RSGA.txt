TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5629 (S18W19)
PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 10/0216Z. THIS EVENT HAD TWO PEAKS AND
MINOR RADIO BURSTS. THE REMAINDER OF THE ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF

LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A BRIEF PERIOD OF MAJOR
STORMING OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES DURING 10/0900-1200Z.
