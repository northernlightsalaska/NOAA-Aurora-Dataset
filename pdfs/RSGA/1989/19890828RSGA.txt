SDF NUMBER 240
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 28 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  CURRENT DISK REGIONS
REMAIN RELATIVELY SMALL AND QUIET.  THE X-RAY BACKGROUND LEVEL
HAS GRADUALLY INCREASED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS, PRESUMEABLY
FROM NEW ACTIVE REGIONS AT (OR BEHIND) THE EAST LIMB.  SEVERAL
OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED RADIO BURSTS HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE
PAST DAY, INCLUDING 280,000 SFU (245 MHZ) AND 180 SFU (2695 MHZ)
AT 28/1009Z AND 220 SFU (2695 MHZ) AT 28/1312Z.  NEW REGION
5668 (N32E79) ROTATED AROUND THE NORTHEAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARE FROM THE REGIONS CURRENTLY ON THE DISK.  ACTIVITY
LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE LONGITUDES
ASSOCIATED WITH OLD REGION 5629 (S17, L-076) APPROACH THE
VISIBLE DISK.
