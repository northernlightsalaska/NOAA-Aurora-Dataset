FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 296
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 23 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED HIGH. REGION 5747 (S26W48)
PRODUCED AN X1/2B FLARE AT 23/1243Z. NO SWEEP EVENTS WERE SEEN
WITH THIS FLARE AND DISCRETE FREQUENCY RADIO BURSTS WERE ONLY
MODERATE AND RESTRICTED TO HIGH FREQUENCIES ONLY. REGION 5747
ALSO PRODUCED M1/SF FLARES AT 23/0425Z AND 23/0651Z. THIS REGION
EXHIBITED GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 5748 (S16W50) GREW
RAPIDLY DURING THE PERIOD AND IS NOW A MODERATE SIZE CLASS E
SUNSPOT GROUP. NEW REGION 5760 (N11E13) EMERGED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN
HIGH FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. REGION 5747 HAS SHOWN ITS
CAPABILITY AS A MAJOR FLARE PRODUCER AND ADDITIONAL GROWTH
SHOULD INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF LARGE CLASS M AND CLASS
X FLARES. REGION 5748 SHOULD BEGIN TO PRODUCE LOW LEVEL
CLASS M FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD. GENERALLY UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS WERE EXPERIENCED DURING THE LATTER HALF. THE
SATELLITE PROTON EVENT CONTINUED. GREATER THAN 10MEV FLUX AT
22/2100Z WAS 2800 P.F.U., ROSE TO 8300 P.F.U. AT 23/0710Z,
AND ENDED THE PERIOD AT 3000 P.F.U.  THE GREATER THAN 100MEV
FLUX BEGAN THE PERIOD AT NEAR 160 P.F.U. AND DECAYED TO
30 P.F.U. AT 23/2100Z. THE PCA CONTINUED IN PROGRESS.
NOTE: RECALIBRATION OF THE GOES PARTICLE CHANNELS IS
UNDERWAY. RECENTLY REPORTED PROTON FLUXES MAY BE CLOSE TO
A FACTOR OF 2 TOO HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
FORECAST TO BE AT MAJOR STORM LEVELS ON 24 OCT AS A RESULT OF
THE X2 FLARE ON 22 OCT. MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ON 25 OCT WITH ACTIVE LEVELS FORECAST FOR
26 OCT. THE GREATER THAN 10MEV PROTON EVENT IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. ADDITIONAL MAJOR FLARES FROM REGION
5747 COULD INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF THE PROTON EVENT AND
ACCOMPANYING POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT.
