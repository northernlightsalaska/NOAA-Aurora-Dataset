FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 125
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 05 MAY 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5470 (N29W00)
PRODUCED AN X2/3B AT 05/0737Z WITH A LONG DURATION TYPE IV AND
TEN CENTIMETER BURST OF 1000 FLUX UNITS. THIS REGION REMAINED
MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX BUT CEASED ITS LATEST GROWTH TREND.
REGION 5464 (S18W52) CONTINUED TO GROW BUT AT A REDUCED RATE.
THE MAGNETIC FIELDS RETAIN THEIR MIXED NATURE IN THIS REGION
BUT ONE OF THE DELTA CONFIGURATIONS MAY BE DECAYING.  REGION
5464 PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 04/2224Z AND AN M1/1B AT 05/0532Z.
NEITHER FLARE PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT RADIO BURSTS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A GENERALLY HIGH LEVEL. BOTH REGIONS 5464 AND 5470 ARE
CAPABLE OF GENERATING MID CLASS M TO CLASS X FLARES. CURRENT
TRENDS INDICATE THAT THE FREQUENCY OF THESE LARGE EVENTS MAY
DECREASE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS AT MID LATITUDES WHILE HIGH LATITUDES EXPERIENCED
ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS. THE MOST DISTURBED PERIOD
WAS 05/0000Z-1030Z. THIS DISTURBANCE WAS PRECEDED BY A
SUDDEN STORM COMMENCEMENT OF 80 GAMMA AT 04/2355Z. A WEAK
PROTON EVENT BEGAN AT 05/0905Z, REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 27 PFU
AT 05/1000Z, AND AT THE END OF THE PERIOD WAS NEARLY OVER.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE GENERALLY AT MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE ENTIRE
FORECAST PERIOD. PULSES OF MAJOR STORM LEVELS SHOULD BE
EXPERIENCED AS THE SHOCK FRONTS FROM THE MANY RECENT FLARES
REACH EARTH. ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL BETWEEN THE
PULSES.  ANOTHER PROTON EVENT, OF HIGHER FLUX, IS POSSIBLE
DURING THE PERIOD.
