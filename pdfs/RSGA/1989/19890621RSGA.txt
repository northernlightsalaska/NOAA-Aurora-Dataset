SDF NUMBER 172
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 21 JUN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS
OWING TO AN M9/1N FLARE FROM REGION 5528 (N20W90) ON 20 JUNE
THAT MAXED AT 2214 UT. A 32-MINUTE DURATION TYPE IV SWEEP AND
AN EVENT-LEVEL RADIO BURST AT 10 CM ACCOMPANIED THE FLARE.
REGION 5528 CROSSED THE WEST LIMB TODAY, ACCOMPANIED BY
SURGING AND CORONAL RAIN.  OTHER FLARE ACTIVITY INCLUDED TWO
M-CLASS FLARES FROM REGIONS 5552 (S18E51) AND 3 M-CLASS
FLARES FROM REGION 5555 (N25E53). BOTH 5552 AND 5555 ARE
MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. FIVE NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED. FOUR
OF THEM CAME OVER THE EAST LIMB, 3 IN THE NORTH AND ONE IN
THE SOUTH, AND ONE EMERGED ON THE DISK. A FILAMENT LOCATED
NEAR N15W05 ON 20 JUNE AT 1417 UT DISAPPEARED BEFORE 1308 UT
TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. BOTH 5552 AND 5555 CONTAIN THE POTENTIAL FOR M-CLASS
X-RAY EVENTS, AND ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THESE REGIONS
COULD LEAD TO X-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET FOR THE PAST 24
HOURS. THE LAST PERIOD AT ACTIVE LEVELS WAS 2100-2400 UT ON
20 JUNE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT QUIET LEVELS UNTIL 23 JUNE, WHEN MINOR
TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS MAY COMMENCE.  THIS ACTIVITY IS
EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR FLARES AND SIGNIFICANT
FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE THAT OCCURRED ON 20 JUNE.
