FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 173
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 22 JUN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS.
REGION 5555 (N26E40) DEVELOPED IN BOTH WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA
AND MAINTAINED ITS MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.  REGION 5552 (S18E33)
HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO REGIONS AND IS NO LONGER MAGNETICALLY
COMPLEX. THERE ARE NOW 19 SPOTTED GROUPS ON THE VISIBLE DISK
BUT ONLY 4 OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED ERUPTIVE AT THIS TIME.
THREE NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED TODAY. TWO OF THEM ARE NEAR
THE SOUTHEAST LIMB BEHIND REGION 5552.  THE THIRD, 5562
(N38E46), EMERGED ON THE DISK.  THERE WAS SURGING ON THE
NORTHWEST LIMB NEAR THE POSITION OF DEPARTED REGION 5528,
AND A LARGE ACTIVE PROMINENCE WAS VISIBLE ON THE SOUTHEAST
LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5555 POSSESSES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT
(M-CLASS) FLARES AND COULD PRODUCE X-CLASS ACTIVITY IF
GROWTH CONTINUES.  THE COMPLEX OF REGIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT (INCLUDING 5552) SHOULD ALSO BE WATCHED FOR
ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT TWO
DAYS IN RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR FLARES AND THE SIGNIFICANT
FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE THAT OCCURRED ON 20 JUNE. STORM
CONDITIONS SHOULD SUBSIDE BY THE THIRD DAY.
