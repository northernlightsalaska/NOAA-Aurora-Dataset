SDF NUMBER 245
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 02 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGIONS 5669 AND 5671
WERE COMBINED TODAY. THE RESULTANT REGION WAS NUMBER 5669 WITH
A LOCATION OF S17E27 (NO FURTHER REFERENCES WILL BE MADE TO
REGION 5671). THIS LARGE AND EXTREMELY COMPLEX REGION SPANS SOME
26 DEGREES IN LONGITUDE AND WAS THE SOURCE OF AN M5/2N FLARE
AT 01/2359Z. MINOR DISCRETE FREQUENCY BURSTS ACCOMPANIED
THE FLARE. THE REGION ALSO PRODUCED THREE ADDITIONAL M-CLASS
FLARES: AN M1/SF AT 02/0156Z, AN M2/1B AT 02/0623Z WITH AN
ASSOCIATED 720 SFU TENFLARE, AND ANOTHER M2/1B AT 02/1140Z WITH
AN ASSOCIATED 360 SFU TENFLARE. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED, WEAK
TYPE II SWEEP BURST OCCURRED AT 02/1353Z. ITS VELOCITY WAS
ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 600 KM/SEC. NEW REGION 5674 (N22W41),
A SIMPLE BIPOLE, WAS NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5669 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES DURING THE PERIOD. THERE IS ALSO A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN
ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARE FROM THIS REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE HIGH
LATITUDE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS.
