FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 335
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 01 DEC 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M2 FLARE OCCURRED
AT 30/2306Z BUT WAS NOT OBSERVED OPTICALLY. SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL
C-CLASS FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD: A
C9/SF FROM 5800 (N26W71) AT 1807Z, A C8/SF FROM 5800 AT 1858Z,
AND A C8/2N FROM 5806 (N19W30) AT 1932Z. REGION 5806 APPEARS TO
HAVE LOST ITS DELTA CONFIGURATION. SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON EAST
LIMB NEAR N20, HINTING AT ADDITIONAL NEW REGIONS WHICH MAY SOON
ROTATE INTO VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 5800 AND 5806 CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY
THREATS FOR SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY. REGION 5800 WILL BE ROTATING
OFF THE SOLAR DISK SOMETIME ON THE SECOND DAY WHICH WILL LOWER
ACTIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS SOMEWHAT. NEW REGIONS ROTATING
INTO VIEW MAY PROVIDE PARTIAL COMPENSATION FOR THE DECREASE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS PREVAILED FROM THE START
OF THE PERIOD UNTIL 1750Z WHEN A NEGATIVE SUDDEN STORM COM-
MENCEMENT WAS OBSERVED. SHORTLY AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT, BOTH
GOES-6 AND GOES-7 OBSERVED MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSINGS, A CON-
DITION WHICH PERSISTED UNTIL ABOUT 2000Z. GEOMAGNETIC CON-
DITIONS HAVE BEEN AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS AT MID-
LATITUDES AND MAJOR TO SEVERE LEVELS AT THE HIGHER LATITUDES.
THIS IMPULSE WAS PROBABLY FROM THE X2/3B FLARE OF 30 NOVEMBER.
THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT CONTINUES. THE PEAK FLUX
OF GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTONS SO FAR WAS 7300 PFU AT 01/1340Z.
LEVELS APPEAR TO BE DECLINING AT THIS TIME. THE PCA EVENT WHICH
BEGAN AT 30/1825Z WAS IN PROGRESS ALL DAY WITH ABSORPION UP TO
ABOUT 7 DB AT 01/1730Z. FIRST INDICATIONS OF A FORBUSH DECREASE
WERE OBSERVED AT ABOUT 01/2000Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 12
HOURS. CONDITIONS SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH TO MINOR STORM
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FIRST DAY, AND MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS
ON THE SECOND DAY. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED BY
DAY 3.
