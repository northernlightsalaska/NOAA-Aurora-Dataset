JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 12 MAY 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5476 (S31W29)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS EVENT: AN M1/SF AT 1109Z. THE
REGION CONTINUES TO DECAY SLOWLY. SURGE ACTIVITY CONTINUED ON
THE EAST LIMB AT N18 BEHIND REGION 5487 (N17E61). ADDITIONAL
PLAGE AND SPOTS APPEAR TO BE ROTATING INTO VIEW BUT THE CLOSE-

WITH THE EXIT OF REGION 5470. THE REMAINDER OF THE SOLAR DISK
AND LIMBS WERE ESSENTIALLY STABLE.

LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 5476 IS THE PRIMARY THREAT FOR M-CLASS
FLARES.
