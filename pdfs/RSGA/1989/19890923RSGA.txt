SDF NUMBER 266
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 23 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 5694 (N26W91)
PRODUCED TWO C-CLASS FLARES WHILE CROSSING THE WEST LIMB. THE
MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE WAS A C4/SF AT 23/0900Z WHICH WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH A TYPE II SWEEP (ESTIMATED SPEED 1600 KM/SEC).
AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED C3 X-RAY BURST OCCURRED AT 23/1335Z.
A TYPE II SWEEP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT; ITS SPEED WAS
ESTIMATED TO BE 1200 KM/SEC. REGION 5698 (S25W24) WAS QUIET
DURING THE PERIOD WHILE SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF DECAY. HOWEVER,
THE REGION REMAINED LARGE AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. NO NEW
REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5698 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
THE REGION MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWED BY TWO
DAYS OF ACTIVE LEVELS. THE ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED IN
RESPONSE TO THE EFFECTS OF A CORONAL HOLE ESTIMATED TO BE AT
N34W17 AT ISSUE TIME. THE RECURRENT PATTERN ALSO SUPPORTS THE
EXPECTED INCREASE IN ACTIVITY LEVELS.
