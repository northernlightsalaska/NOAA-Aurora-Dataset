SDF NUMBER 300
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 27 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED HIGH. REGION 5747 (S30W98)
PRODUCED AN X1/1N AT 27/1904Z WITH A 10CM BURST OF 1100 FLUX
UNITS. THIS REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M6/SF AT 27/1135Z WITH A
1000 FLUX UNIT BURST AT 10CM. A VERY LARGE AND DENSE BRIGHT
SURGE TO 0.56R ABOVE THE LIMB WAS OBSERVED FROM THE AREA OF
DEPARTED REGION 5748 (S18W96) AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN M4
X-RAY BURST AT 26/2341Z. THIS EVENT ALSO PRODUCED MODERATE
INTENSITY TYPE II AND WEAK TYPE IV BURSTS. ACTIVE SURGING AND
ELEVATED PROMINENCE MATERIAL CONTINUED THROUGH THE PERIOD
ABOVE THE LIMB WHERE REGION 5747 MADE WEST LIMB TRANSIT. SMALL
REGIONS 5765 (S25E12) AND 5766 (S29E45) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE MODERATE
FOR 28 OCT WITH REGION 5747 BEING THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF CLASS M
FLARES. AN ISOLATED X FLARE FROM BEYOND THE SOUTHWEST LIMB IS
ALSO POSSIBLE. COMPLETE LIMB OCCULTATION OF THIS REGION SHOULD
REDUCE THE OBSERVED FLARE INTENSITIES TO THE LOW RANGE FOR
29-30 OCT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE DURING
THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE PROTON EVENT AND PCA CONTINUED DURING
THE PERIOD BUT WEAKENED. THE GT 10MEV FLUX AT 26/2100Z WAS
330 P.F.U. AND DECAYED SMOOTHLY TO 55 P.F.U. AT 27/2100Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE FOR THE DURATION OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANOTHER PROTON FLARE
FROM BEHIND THE SOUTHWEST LIMB, THE PCA AND PROTON EVENT
SHOULD DECAY TO NEAR BACKGROUND LEVELS ON 28 OCT.
