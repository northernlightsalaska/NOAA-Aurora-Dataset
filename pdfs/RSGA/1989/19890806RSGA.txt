SDF NUMBER 218
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 06 AUG 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THREE M-CLASS FLARES
OCCURRED. THE FIRST, AN M3/2B AT 06/0052Z, WAS PRODUCED BY
REGION 5623 (S15W01). THE SECOND WAS AN M2/1N AT 06/0751Z FROM
WITHIN REGION 5633 (S27E40). THE THIRD WAS AN M1/SN AT 06/1217Z
FROM REGION 5622 (S27W24) WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 1000 SFU
TENFLARE AND A STRONG TYPE IV RADIO SWEEP. REGION 5629 (S17E34)
CONTINUED TO GROW SLOWLY WHILE MAINTAINING A MAGNETIC DELTA
CONFIGURATION WITHIN ITS LARGE LEADER SPOT. THIS REGION REMAINED
RELATIVELY QUIET DESPITE ITS COMPLEXITY. NEW REGION 5635
(N14E72), A SMALL UNIPOLE, WAS NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 5622, 5623, 5628 (N09W32), 5629, AND 5634
(S14E69) ARE CAPABLE OF M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION. REGION 5629
MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE DURING THE PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS WITH
BRIEF PERIODS OF UNSETTLED LEVELS RECORDED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED.
