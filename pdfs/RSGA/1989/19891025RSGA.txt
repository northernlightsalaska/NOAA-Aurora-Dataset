SDF NUMBER 298
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 25 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED HIGH. REGION 5747 (S27W73)
PRODUCED AN M8/2N FLARE AT 25/1639Z. NO TYPE II OR IV BURSTS
WERE OBSERVED AND MODERATE TO MAJOR DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS WERE
OBSERVED ONLY AT 4995MHZ AND ABOVE. REGION 5747 ALSO PRODUCED A
SHORT DURATION M1/1F AT 25/0500Z. THIS REGION IS TOO NEAR THE
LIMB FOR MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OR DETERMINATION OF TRENDS.
SUBFLARES WERE PRODUCED BY SEVERAL OF THE OTHER DISK REGIONS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
PREDOMINANTLY HIGH FOR THE PERIOD. REGION 5747 WILL MAKE ITS
WEST LIMB TRANSIT ON 28 OCT. HOWEVER, MAJOR FLARES WILL
CONTINUE TO BE VISIBLE IN X-RAYS FOR 29-30 OCT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS ACTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
PERIOD. MINOR STORM LEVELS WERE EXPERIENCED (MAINLY AT HIGH
LATITUDES) DURING THE 25/0300-1200Z INTERVAL. NEAR QUIET
GEOMAGNETIC CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
PERIOD. THE GT 10MEV FLUX BEGAN THE PERIOD AT 2200 P.F.U.,
REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 4100 P.F.U. AT 25/0210Z, AND DECAYED TO
1400 P.F.U. BY 25/2100Z. THE GT 100MEV FLUX PEAKED AT 130
P.F.U. NEAR 25/0015Z AND DROPPED BELOW THE 100 P.F.U. LEVEL
AT 25/0335Z. THE PCA REMAINED IN PROGRESS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
IS FORECAST TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE ON 26 OCT. ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON 27-28 OCT IN RESPONSE TO
THE X5 FLARE ON 24 OCT. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS MAY
EXPERIENCE MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS DURING THE 27-28 OCT
INTERVAL. THE GT 10MEV PROTON EVENT AND PCA ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
