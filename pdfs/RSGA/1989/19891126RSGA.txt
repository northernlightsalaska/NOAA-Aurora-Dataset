FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 330
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 26 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. AN X1/2N FLARE OCCURRED
IN REGION 5800 (N13W08) AT 25/2355Z. NOTED WITH THIS EVENT WAS A
610 SFU TENFLARE, SIGNIFICANT TYPE 4 SWEEP, AND LOOP PROMINENCE
SYSTEM. AN M4/2B FLARE OCCURRED AT 1941Z FROM REGION 5800 AGAIN
WITH A TYPE 4 SWEEP AND 430 SFU TENFLARE. THIS REGION CONTINUES
TO DISPLAY GROWTH IN ITS TRAILING SPOT STRUCTURE AND IS COMPLEX
MAGNETICALLY. REGION 5808 (S07W20) CONTINUES ITS RAPID GROWTH.
THIS REGION IS ALSO BECOMING MORE COMPLEX AND HAS EXHIBITED
OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES. ISOLATED SUBFLARES HAVE ALSO BEEN NOTED IN
REGIONS 5806 (N19E41) AND 5804 (N43E06) TO A LESSER EXTENT. NEW
REGION 5809 (S18E67) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5800 WITH ITS COMPLEX MAGNETIC
STRUCTURE AS NOTED BY ITS KINKED INVERSION LINE ALONG WITH
ITS CONTINUED GROWTH IN ITS SPOTS STRUCTURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO
PRODUCE OCCASIONAL M-CLASS EVENTS WITH THE POTENTIAL THERE FOR
ISOLATED X-CLASS ACTIVITY AND PROTONS. REGION 5808 ALSO SHOWS
PROMISE FOR INCREASED FLARE ACTIVITY AS IT CONTINUES TO MATURE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY WITH THE FIELD
BECOMING MORE DISTURBED AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT X1/2N EVENT.
