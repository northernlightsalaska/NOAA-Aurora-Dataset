SDF NUMBER 274
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 01 OCT 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE
PERIOD WAS AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED C6 AT 01/0036Z. REGION
5712 (S18E16) PRODUCED TWO SMALL CLASS C FLARES. THIS REGION
APPEARED TO STABLILIZE AS A SMALL EXTENDED CLASS F GROUP WHICH
IS TRAILER DOMINANT IN WHITE LIGHT. REGION 5719 (N25E51) WAS
SPLIT OFF FROM REGION 5714 (N29E40). NEW REGIONS 5720 (S09E02)
AND 5721 (N29E82) WERE NUMBERED. REGION 5721 WAS REPORTED AS
A SMALL SPOT COMING OVER THE LIMB BUT THERE MAY BE A LARGER
REGION BEHIND THIS SPOT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE LOW
TO MODERATE. AN ISOLATED CLASS M FLARE IS POSSIBLE FROM
REGION 5712. IF NEW REGION 5721 IS THE RETURN OF OLD REGION
5697 AND GROWTH CONTINUED ON THE INVISIBLE HEMISPHERE,
IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE ACTIVITY LEVELS COULD BECOME ELEVATED
DUE TO THIS AREA.

P.F.U. AT THAT TIME. BY 01/2100Z THE PARTICLE FLUX HAD
DECAYED TO 85 P.F.U. AT GT 10MEV, AND WAS NEAR BACKGROUND AT
