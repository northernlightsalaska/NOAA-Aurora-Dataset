SDF NUMBER 270
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 27 SEP 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5698 (S25W77)
PRODUCED THE PERIOD'S ONLY M-FLARE: AN M1/SF AT 27/1707Z WHICH
WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MINOR RADIO EMISSION. 5698 REMAINED THE
DOMINANT GROUP ON THE DISK, IN TERMS OF SIZE AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. REGION 5708 (S15E50) BEGAN TO DECAY AND WAS FAIRLY
QUIET DURING THE DAY. THREE NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY:
5710 (N32E66), 5711 (N19E05), AND 5712 (S17E69). NEW REGION
5712 MAY BE THE RETURN OF THE TRAILER PORTION OF THE OLD 5669
COMPLEX. VERY STRONG CALCIUM XV EMISSION WAS OBSERVED IN THE
VICINITY OF THIS REGION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 5698, 5708, AND 5712 ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
M-CLASS ACTIVITY. REGION 5698 PROVIDES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN
ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR STORM LEVELS WERE RECORDED AT
HIGHER LATITUDES VERY EARLY IN THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. EPISODES OF ACTIVE LEVELS MAY
OCCUR AT HIGH LATITUDES DURING THE FINAL DAY OF THE PERIOD.
