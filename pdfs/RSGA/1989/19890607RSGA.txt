FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 158
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 07 JUN 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH DUE TO THE NUMBER OF
M-CLASS EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD. THE MAJORITY OF THE FLARE
ACTIVITY WAS FROM REGION 5521 (S19E24) WHICH SHOWED A SLIGHT
SIMPLIFICATION DURING THE DAY.   M-CLASS EVENTS FROM 5521
WERE AS FOLLOWS:  M3/SN AT 0155Z,  M1/1N AT 1012Z,  M1/SN
AT 1054Z, M1/SN AT 1918Z. AN ADDITIONAL M-CLASS EVENT, AN M2/SF
AT 2054Z, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW REGION 5530 (S10E85). SOLAR
FLUX LEVELS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT UPWARD TREND NEAR THE END
OF THE PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ENTRANCE OF 5530 AND NEW
REGION 5528 (N17E72). BOTH REGIONS DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANT
SURGE ACTIVITY ON THE EAST LIMB THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND 5528
WAS REPORTED TO DISPLAY STRONG YELLOW LINE EMISSION AS WELL.
THE REMAINDER OF THE SOLAR DISK AND LIMBS WERE RELATIVELY QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THE PRIMARY THREATS FOR SIGNIFICANT FLARE
ACTIVITY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE 5521, 5528, AND 5530.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD, INITIALLY QUIET, ATTAINED STORM
LEVELS DURING THE PERIOD AND RETURNED TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS BY THE END OF THE DAY.  THE STORM BEGAN WITH A SUDDEN
COMMENCEMENT AT 2315Z, BUT ENDED MARKEDLY AT ABOUT 1230Z.
MID-LATITUDES PEAKED AT MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE
DISTURBANCE AND HIGH LATITUDES ATTAINED MAJOR STORM LEVELS
BRIEFLY. THE DISTURBANCE WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE SOLAR
ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED ON 03 JUNE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. SUBSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME HOURS
FOR THE FIRST DAY. SOLAR CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS MAY CONTRIBUTE
TO ACTIVITY LATE ON THE THIRD DAY.
