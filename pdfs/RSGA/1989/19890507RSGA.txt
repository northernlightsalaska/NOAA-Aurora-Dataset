FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 127
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 07 MAY 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. FLARE ACTIVITY WAS
CONFINED TO C-CLASS SINCE YESTERDAY BUT THE DISK HAS BEEN
INTERESTING DUE TO THE APPEARANCE OF FOUR NEW REGIONS. NEW
REGION 5479 (N13E20) WAS BORN VERY NEAR TWO OLDER SPOT GROUPS
AND MAY INTERACT WITH THEM TO PRODUCE FLARES SOON. AMONG THE
MATURE GROUPS VISIBLE REGIONS 5464 (S19W78), 5470 (N29W25),
AND 5476 (S30E38) ARE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE. A LARGE PROMINENCE
SPANNING 25 DEGREES ON THE SW LIMB LIFTED OFF BETWEEN 2135
AND 2205Z ON 6 MAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THE CURRENT LULL IN M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS
LIKELY TO END SOON AS ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REGIONS MAY
BECOME ACTIVE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS AT MID-LATITUDES SINCE 0515Z WHEN A SUDDEN IMPULSE
OF 90 NANOTESLA WAS RECORDED AT BOULDER. HIGH LATITUDE SITES
HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY MORE DISTURBED. THE X2/3B FLARE OF 5
MAY FROM DISK CENTER IS THOUGHT TO HAVE FUELED THE DISTURB-
ANCE. THE PROTON EVENT AT 10 MEV CONTINUES BUT IS SLOWLY
DECAYING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR ANOTHER DAY.
