SDF NUMBER 325
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 21 NOV 1989
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5793 (S26W60)
PRODUCED TWO X-CLASS FLARES DURING THE PERIOD. THE FIRST WAS AN
X1/2B AT 20/2135Z ASSOCIATED WITH A 620 SFU TENFLARE AND
SIGNIFICANT TYPES II AND IV RADIO SWEEPS. THE SECOND WAS AN
X4/2B AT 21/1347Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MAJOR TYPE II
RADIO SWEEP. THE REGION DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANT DECAY AS ITS MAIN
PENUMBRAL MASS SPLIT INTO THREE SEGMENTS. THE MAGNETIC STRUCTURE
OF THE REGION APPEARED TO SIMPLIFY AS WELL. REGION 5796 (N13E08)
DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD, BUT REMAINED
QUIET. NEW REGIONS 5802 (S12E14), 5803 (S12E46), 5804 (N44E64),
AND 5805 (S11E69) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5793, THOUGH DECAYING, STILL HOLDS
POTENTIAL FOR M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION. THERE IS ALSO A SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE FROM THIS REGION. REGION
5796 MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE DURING THE PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS. THE FINAL
DAY IS EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE IN RESPONSE TO TODAY'S X4 FLARE.
