JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 103 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO AN M3 X-RAY
EVENT AT 0852Z. THE EVENT WAS NOT OBSERVED OPTICALLY. REGION
6583 (N09E34) IS CURRENTLY THE LARGEST, MOST COMPLEX GROUP ON
THE DISK AND CONTINUES TO GROW. IT APPEARS TO HAVE A DELTA
CONFIGURATION AND IT PRODUCED A C8/SN AT 0153Z AND A C9/SB AT
0532Z. THE SPOTS IN REGION 6580 (N29W10) HAVE MERGED INTO A
DELTA CONFIGURATION WITH AN EAST-WEST INVERSION LINE. THIS
GROUP PRODUCED FREQUENT SUBFLARE ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON EAST LIMB AT S12 AND AT S28 DURING THE
LATTER PART OF THE DAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6583 AND 6580 ARE THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR
M-CLASS OR LARGER EVENTS. NEW REGIONS ARE EXPECTED TO ROTATE
ONTO THE DISK AT THE LATITUDES WHERE SURGING WAS OBSERVED TODAY.
THIS SHOULD INCREASE BACKGROUND FLUX LEVELS. IN PARTICULAR THE
REMNANTS OF OLD REGION 6555 (S24, L-186) SHOULD BE CLEARLY VIS-
IBLE TOMORROW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
