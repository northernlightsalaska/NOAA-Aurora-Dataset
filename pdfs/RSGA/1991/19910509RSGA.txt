JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 129 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6615 (S08W58) PRO-
DUCED THE MAJORITY OF TODAY'S FREQUENT C-FLARE LEVEL ACTIVITY
INCLUDING THE LARGEST EVENT: A C8/SF AT 1237Z. THE REGION
CONTINUES TO BE A LARGE, COMPACT DELTA GROUP, ALTHOUGH THERE
WAS SOME INDICATION OF SLIGHT DECAY NEAR THE END OF THE DAY.
REGION 6625 (N12E61) PRODUCED MOST OF THE REST OF TODAY'S
FLARES AND SHOWED STEADY GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD. A BUSHY,
10 DEGREE FILAMENT JUST WEST OF REGION 6619 (N29E22) DISAPPEARED
BETWEEN 0600-0650Z. REGION 6619 CONTINUES TO BE A LARGE COMPACT
DELTA GROUP BUT PRODUCED ONLY A COUPLE OF SUBFLARES. REGION 6621
(N09E31) SHOWED SOME GROWTH DURING THE DAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6615 IS CONSIDERED THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR
M-CLASS EVENTS, ESPECIALLY IF IT SHOULD SUDDENLY ENTER A RAPID
DECAY PHASE. REGIONS 6619 AND 6621 ARE ALSO RESPECTABLE AND
COULD PRODUCE M-CLASS LEVEL ACTIVITY. THERE CONTINUES TO BE
A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED FROM THE START
OF THE DAY UNTIL ABOUT 1500Z WHEN CONDITIONS BECAME UNSETTLED
TO ACTIVE. THE INCREASE APPEARS TO BE A RESULT OF THE M2
SOLAR FLARE OF 07 MAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT TWELVE HOURS. AFTER THAT CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN TO
QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS THROUGH THE END OF THE SECOND DAY.
ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON THE THIRD DAY IN RESPONSE
TO TODAY'S DISAPPEARING FILAMENT AND POSSIBLY IN RESPONSE TO
THE ARRIVAL OF A SHOCK FROM YESTERDAY'S TYPE II RADIO SWEEP
EVENT.
