JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 039 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 FEB 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGIONS 6471 (NOW MORE
THAN A DAY BEYOND THE SOUTHWEST LIMB) AND 6487 (N15E28)
CONTRIBUTED TO TWO MAJOR FLARES. THE FIRST WAS AN M5/SN AT
07/2123Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 1900 SFU TENFLARE. A
COINCIDENT ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS NOTED AT SW10 FROM OLD 6471.
THE SECOND WAS AN M7/SF AT 08/1607Z WITH A COINCIDENT EVENT
OCCURRING AT SW12. A LACK OF RADIO COVERAGE PREVENTED A RADIO
BURST OR SWEEP ASSESSMENT OF THIS FLARE. REGION 6487 DISPLAYED
MINOR GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD. A DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION
MAY HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE NORTHWESTERN PORTION OF THIS REGION.
REGION 6471 WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR AN M2 X-RAY BURST WHICH
OCCURRED AT 08/0249Z. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED LONG DURATION
M4 X-RAY BURST OCCURRED AT 08/0748Z ACCOMPANIED BY A 200 SFU
TENFLARE. REGION 6480 (S10W28) PRODUCED TWO C-CLASS FLARES EARLY
IN THE PERIOD. NEW REGION 6489 (S11E68) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. M-CLASS ACTIVITY MAY OCCUR FROM REGION 6487. THERE IS
ALSO A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN X-CLASS FLARE FROM THIS REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN RANGED FROM QUIET TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR STORMING OCCURRED AT
HIGH LATITUDES FROM 08/1200-1500Z. THE LONG DURATION M4
PRODUCED A SATELLITE-LEVEL PROTON ENHANCEMENT AT GREATER
THAN 10 MEV. IT BEGAN AT 08/0915Z, REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 9 PFU
AT 08/1105Z, AND WAS IN PROGRESS (LEVELED OFF NEAR 5 PFU) AT
THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. BRIEF PERIODS OF ACTIVE
LEVELS MAY OCCUR IN RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL
HOLE.
