JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 086 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6555 (S23W47)
PRODUCED SEVEN SUBFLARES, THREE OF WHICH REACHED C-CLASS. THE
LARGEST OF THESE WAS A C3/SF AT 27/1758Z. THE REGION DISPLAYED
PENUMBRAL DECAY AND FRAGMENTATION, BUT REMAINED VERY COMPLEX,
ESPECIALLY IN MAGNETIC ASPECTS. MINOR GROWTH WAS NOTED IN REGION
6560 (S10W24) WHILE REGION 6558 (S14E01) CONTINUED TO DECLINE.
NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6555 REMAINS CAPABLE OF M-CLASS FLARE
PRODUCTION. ISOLATED X-CLASS ACTIVITY IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY
GIVEN THE MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY OF THE REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE HIGH LATITUDES WERE AT ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE
HIGH LATITUDES ARE EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS.
