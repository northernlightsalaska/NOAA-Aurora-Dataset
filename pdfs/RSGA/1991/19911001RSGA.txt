JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 274 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGIONS 6850 (S12W02)
AND 6853 (S19E02) MONOPOLIZED THE DAY'S FLARE RECORD WITH
FREQUENT RADIO-RICH EVENTS OF C AND M-CLASS. THE MOST ENERGETIC
FLARES WERE AN M3/0F AT 0616Z FROM 6853, AN M1/0F AT 1044Z FROM
6850, AND AN M1/0N AT 30/2232Z, ALSO FROM 6850. BOTH REGIONS
CONTINUE TO IMPRESS IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA AND SHOW NO SIGNS
OF FATIGUE. WHITE LIGHT GROWTH AND RESTRUCTURING WAS READILY
APPARENT IN THE CENTRAL AND TRAILER SPOTS OF 6850. ELSEWHERE,
TWO NEW REGIONS, 6860 (S27E20) AND 6861 (N13E51), WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. MORE M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS ANTICIPATED TO ORIGINATE
IN REGIONS 6850 AND 6853, AND IF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OCCURS,
AN X-CLASS FLARE MAY RESULT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
UNTIL 1815Z WHEN A SUDDEN IMPULSE MEASURING 17 NANOTESLA AT
BOULDER WAS RECORDED. THE GOES-6 SPACECRAFT EXPERIENCED A
BRIEF MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSING SOMEWHAT LATER AT 1943Z. THE
FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS SINCE. THE
SOURCE OF THE SHOCK MAY BE THE DISAPPEARING FILAMENT OF 28
SEPT., OR THE M7 FLARE OF 29 SEPT. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV
PROTON ENHANCEMENT THAT BEGAN ABOUT 30/0700Z SLOWLY INTENS-
IFIED, FINALLY CROSSING THE 10 PFU EVENT THRESHOLD AT 1740Z.
THE PEAK FLUX TO THIS POINT HAS BEEN JUST ABOVE 10 PFU.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD END THE PERIOD.
