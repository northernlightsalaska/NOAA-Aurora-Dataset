JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 287 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6878 (S21E29)
PRODUCED AN M6/3N FLARE AT 14/1738Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
WEAK RADIO EMISSIONS. THE REGION PRODUCED FOUR SUBFLARES
INCLUDING A C8/SF PRIOR TO THE MAJOR FLARE, BUT DISPLAYED NO
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OR CHANGES DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 6879
(N22E63) PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS FLARES INCLUDING AN M1/SF AT
14/2106Z AND AN M1/SF AT 14/0322Z, NEITHER OF WHICH WERE
ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT RADIO EMISSIONS. THIS REGION ALSO
DISPLAYED NO NOTABLE CHANGES. REGION 6873 (S23W06) SHOWED SIGNS
OF SLIGHT DECAY, BUT REMAINED THE MOST COMPLEX SPOT GROUPING
(DKC/BETA-GAMMA-DELTA) ON THE VISIBLE DISK. IT PRODUCED TWO
SUBFLARES DURING THE PERIOD. NO NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6878 AND 6879 ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
M-CLASS FLARES. ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY MAY OCCUR AS WELL
GIVEN THEIR RECENT FLARE HISTORIES. REGION 6873 ALSO APPEARS
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING M-CLASS FLARES AND CANNOT BE RULED OUT FOR
AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE GIVEN ITS MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS ON THE FIRST DAY.
ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD DUE TO POSSIBLE CORONAL HOLE
EFFECTS.
