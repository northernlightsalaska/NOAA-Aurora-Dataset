(S08E59) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6734 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARES. THERE IS ALSO A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR
FLARE FROM THIS REGION. REGIONS 6741, 6749, AND 6757 ARE ALSO
CAPABLE OF ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HOWEVER, AN ISOLATED PERIOD OF
ACTIVE LEVELS OCCURRED BETWEEN 30/0600-0900Z. THE ACTIVE
PERIOD WAS PRECEDED BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 23 NANOTESLA
(MEASURED BY THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER) AT 30/0558Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS.
