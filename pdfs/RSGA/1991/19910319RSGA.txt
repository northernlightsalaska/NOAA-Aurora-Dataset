JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 078 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 19 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6545 (S09W42) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY MAJOR FLARE, AN M6/2B AT 0200Z WHICH WAS AC-
COMPANIED BY VERY STRONG RADIO BURSTS AND A MODERATE TYPE II.
THE FLARE AND BURSTS WERE OF SHORT DURATION AND SMALL INTEGRATED
FLUX. THIS EVENT WAS PRECEDED BY AN M3 AT 0122Z WHICH HAD WEAK
RADIO BURSTS AND A STRONG TYPE II BUT WAS NOT OBSERVED OPTI-
CALLY. REGION 6545 PRODUCED ADDITIONAL M-CLASS EVENTS: AN M1/SB
AT 2142Z, AN M1/2B AT 2310Z, AND AN M1/SF AT 0614Z. THIS REGION
CONTINUES TO SHOW DECAY AND SIMPLIFICATION AND ITS FLARE
ACTIVITY HAS BECOME LESS FREQUENT AND LESS INTENSE. REGION
6555 (S22E55) PRODUCED OCCASIONAL FLARES DURING THE PERIOD.
THE LARGEST WERE AN M1/SF AT 2237Z AND A C9/SF AT 0833Z. THIS
GROUP IS NOW THE LARGEST ON THE DISK WITH AN AREA OF ABOUT 1500
MILLIONTHS, MOST OF WHICH IS CONTAINED IN A LARGE PENUMBRAL MASS
WITH A NORTH-SOUTH EXTENT OF ABOUT 8 DEGREES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE, WITH A CONTINUED CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR
FLARE. REGIONS 6545 AND 6555 SHOULD PRODUCE OCCASIONAL M-EVENTS,
AND REGION 6545 IS STILL CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAIN THREAT FOR A
MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSLTY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. SOME
ACTIVE LEVEL CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES
DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE DAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
