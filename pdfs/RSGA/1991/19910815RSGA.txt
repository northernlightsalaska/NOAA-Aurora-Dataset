JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 227 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S LARGEST FLARE WAS
A C6/SN AT 1802Z PRODUCED BY NEWLY ASSIGNED REGION 6784(S19E31).
THIS REGION HAS SHOWN VERY RAPID GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE
LAST 24 HOURS. THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE DISK CONTINUES TO
PROLIFERATE WITH NEW FLUX AS A TOTAL OF 6 NEW REGIONS WERE AS-
SIGNED TODAY. REGIONS 6781 (S19E46), 6782 (S10E49), AND 6783
(S14E46) COMPRISE A COMPLICATED SET OF STACKED BIPOLES WITH
A COMMON INVERSION LINE AND OVERLAPPING PLAGE AREAS. THIS
COMPLEX SHOWED DEVELOPMENT TODAY BUT PRODUCED ONLY SMALL FLARES.
THREE FILAMENT DISAPPEARENCES WERE NOTED: 18 DEGREES AT S37E59-
S37E41, 14 DEGREES AT S20W17-S22W28, AND 8 DEGREES AT S08W63.
TODAY'S 10.7 CM FLUX JUMPED MARKEDLY IN RESPONSE TO THE SUDDEN
EMERGENCE AND GROWTH OF NEW SOLAR REGIONS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6784 IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY THREAT FOR
MODERATE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE
FROM THE COMPLEX OF 6781/6782/6783.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY ACTIVE WITH SOME PERIODS
OF MINOR STORM TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE
DISTURBANCE APPEARS TO BE A RESULT OF RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE
EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT ACTIVE LEVELS WITH MINOR STORM PERIODS
AT HIGH LATITUDES OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. A GRADUAL DECLINE
IS EXPECTED BY THE THIRD DAY.
