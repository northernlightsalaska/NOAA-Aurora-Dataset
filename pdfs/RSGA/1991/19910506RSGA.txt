JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 126 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO THE CONTINU-
ATION OF YESTERDAY'S M1/1N FLARE INTO TODAY'S PERIOD: THE EVENT
STARTED AT 05/2018Z, ATTAINED MAXIMUM AT 05/2100Z, AND ENDED AT
2128Z. THE EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY REGION 6615 (S10W16), A REGION
WHICH IS SHOWING REMARKABLE CONTINUED GROWTH AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY IN AN EAST-WEST INVERSION LINE DELTA CONFIGURATION.
THE REGION PRODUCED MOST OF THE REST OF TODAY'S C-CLASS LEVEL
ACTIVITY. ALSO CONTRIBUTING SOME C-FLARE ACTIVITY TODAY WERE
REGION 6619 (N28E58), A LARGE 880 MILLIONTHS D-TYPE BETA-DELTA
GROUP AND REGION 6621 (N07E68).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN REGION 6615 SUGGEST THAT IT
IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE M-LEVEL ACTIVITY. REGION 6619 MIGHT ALSO
MAKE A CONTRIBUTION, GIVEN ITS APPARENT MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED TOMORROW, BECOMING UNSETTLED
TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE ON THE SECOND DAY, AND RETURNING TO UNSET-
TLED BY THE THIRD DAY. AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE ON
THE SECOND DAY IN RESPONSE TO THE LONG DURATION M1 EVENT OF 05
MAY.
