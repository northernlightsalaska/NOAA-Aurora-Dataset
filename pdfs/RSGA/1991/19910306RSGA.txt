SDF NUMBER 065 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6538 (S23E68)
PRODUCED AN M6/SF FLARE AT 05/2329Z ASSOCIATED WITH A 1600 SFU
TENFLARE. THE REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/SB AT 06/0749Z (WHICH
WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 630 SFU TENFLARE) ALONG WITH SEVERAL
C-CLASS FLARES. THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY DECLINED IN THE REGION
DURING THE PERIOD ALTHOUGH STRONG SURGING AND LOOP PROMINENCES
PERSISTED. TWO OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M-CLASS X-RAY BURSTS WERE
OBSERVED: AN M1 AT 06/1040Z AND ANOTHER M1 AT 06/1056Z. REGION
6537 (S09E55) WHICH PRODUCED AN X1 YESTERDAY WAS ONLY ABLE TO
PRODUCE A FEW ISOLATED SUBFLARES. REGION 6536 (N18E53) PRODUCED
SEVERAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES. NEW REGION 6540 (N13E63) WAS
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6538 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES AND MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN OCCASIONAL X-CLASS FLARE.
REGIONS 6536 AND 6537 MAY PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ISOLATED PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING
OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE
PERIOD. THE STORMING MAY HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF CORONAL
HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND AT
ACTIVE LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES DUE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
