JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 021 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6455 (S13W63)
PRODUCED AN M6/2N FLARE AT 0028Z ACCOMPANIED BY A MODEST RADIO
RESPONSE. THE ONLY OTHER M-CLASS EVENT WAS AN UNSEEN M2 AT
0643Z. ANALYSIS HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEMS AT
BOULDER THE LATTER HALF OF THE PERIOD, BUT EARLY REPORTS SUGGEST
REGION 6455 IS STILL CAPABLE OF ENERGETIC ACTIVITY. REPORTS OF
STRONG CALCIUM XV (YELLOW LINE) EMISSION OFF THE SOUTHEAST LIMB
WERE RECEIVED, POSSIBLY HERALDING THE APPEARANCE OF A HOT ACTIVE
REGION SOON TO BE VISIBLE. THREE NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED,
6463 (S06E58), 6464 (N27E55), AND 6465 (N09E62).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6455, 6462 (S15E68), AND THE AS YET UN-
NUMBERED CALCIUM XV SOURCE NEAR SE 15, ARE THE BEST CANDIDATES
FOR M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO MILDLY UNSETTLED THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
