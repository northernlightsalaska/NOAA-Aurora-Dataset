JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 031 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  AN X1/2B FLARE OCCURRED
AT 31/0153UT.  THIS FLARE WAS SHARED BETWEEN REGIONS 6462
(S18W57) AND 6469 (S14W40), HOWEVER, THERE WERE ALSO FLARE
BRIGHTENINGS IN REGIONS 6466 (S09W53) AND 6476 (N20E30) DURING
THIS TIME AS WELL.  THE X1 FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TYPE II
AND IV SWEEPS AS WELL AS MODERATE RADIO AT DISCRETE FREQUENCIES.
OTHER EVENTS OF THE DAY INCLUDED TWO SMALL M FLARES, AN M1/1N
AT 30/2214UT FROM REGION 6469 AND AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED
M1 AT 31/1147UT.  OF THE LARGE REGIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST, ONLY
REGION 6462 APPEARS TO BE IN DECLINE.  REGIONS 6469 AND 6466
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY EVOLVE.  THE LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK,
REGION 6471 (S12E02) RETAINS ITS DELTA CONFIGURATION, BUT HAS
BEEN QUIET.  THERE IS EVIDENCE OF INCREASED SHEAR IN REGIONS
6471, 6466 AND 6469.  THERE IS STRONG CA XV EMISSION ON THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB.  THE 10.7CM RADIO FLUX DECLINED TODAY, THE
FIRST DROP SINCE 21 JAN.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH.  THE 6462/6466/6469 COMPLEX OF REGIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST
AS WELL AS REGION 6471 HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  A PROTON EVENT BEGAN AT
31/1130UT.  THE PEAK FLUX TO DATE IS 220PFU AT 31/1615UT.
THE X1 FLARE DESCRIBED IN PART IA IS THOUGHT TO BE THE SOURCE
OF THIS EVENT.  A PCA EVENT IS IN PROGRESS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO START THE PERIOD AT UNSETTLED LEVELS.  THE FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BECOME MORE ACTIVE LATE ON 1 FEB REACHING STORM
LEVELS ON 2 FEB.  THE PROTON EVENT AND ACCOMPANYING PCA IS
EXPECTED TO SLOWLY DECLINE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
