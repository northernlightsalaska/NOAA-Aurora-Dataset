JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 028 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. FOUR M-CLASS EVENTS
WERE OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD. ONE OF THESE WAS FROM 6466
(S09W14): AN M1/1N AT 0154Z. THE OTHER THREE WERE FROM 6471
(S10E41) AS FOLLOWS: M1/SF AT 1249Z, M1/1N AT 1759Z, AND M1/1N
AT 1955Z. AN ADDITIONAL M1/SF OCCURRED JUST AFTER THE END OF
THE PERIOD AT 2101Z, APPARENTLY FROM A NEW REGION ROTATING OVER
THE EAST LIMB AT N03E80. REGION 6471 DOMINATES THE DISK IN SIZE
(1660  MILLIONTHS) AND FLARE PRODUCTIVITY. THE REGION SHOWS A
STRONG DELTA IN THE LARGE TRAILING PORTION OF THE GROUP. RE-
GION 6462 (S18W14) IS ALSO LARGE, BUT SHOWED A MORE RELAXED MAG-
NETIC CONFIGURATION AND PRODUCED ONLY A FEW SUBFLARES. REGION
6466 SHOWS SOME DECAY AND RECONFIGURATION AS ITS MAIN SPOT SPLIT
UP TODAY, BUT IT CONTINUES TO POSSESS A CLEAR DELTA AND REMAINS
POTENT. OTHER REGIONS ON THE DISK ARE SHOWING GROWTH: IN PARTI-
CULAR,  6476  (N23E66) IS A  370 MILLIONTHS EAO PRODUCING
OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES, REGION 6469 (S12E03) PRODUCED AN UPPER
LEVEL C-FLARE, AND REGION 6465 (N09W30) ALSO PRODUCED AN UPPER
LEVEL C-FLARE. TODAY'S 10.7 CM FLUX LEVEL WAS AT 327, A NEW HIGH
FOR THE CURRENT SOLAR CYCLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THE PRIMARY THREAT FOR MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY
IS FROM REGION 6471, ALTHOUGH A CONTRIBUTION FROM 6466 IS ALSO
POSSIBLE. THESE TWO REGIONS, TOGETHER WITH 6462 ARE EXPECTED TO
KEEP ACTIVITY TO AT LEAST MODERATE LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET. THE GREATER THAN 10
MEV PROTONS CONTINUED TO BE ENHANCED ABOUT AN ORDER OF MAG-
NITUDE ABOVE BACKGROUND BUT DID NOT REACH EVENT LEVEL. THE
PEAK FLUX DURING THE DAY WAS 4 PFU AT 0850Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
AN ENHANCEMENT IS EXPECTED LATE TOMORROW IN RESPONSE TO THE
X1 FLARE OF 27 JANUARY, LASTING THROUGH MOST OF THE SECOND
DAY. CONDITIONS SHOULD GRADUALLY DECLINE TO UNSETTLED THERE-
AFTER.
