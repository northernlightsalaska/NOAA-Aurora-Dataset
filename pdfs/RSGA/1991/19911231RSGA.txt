JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 365 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. FIVE M-CLASS EVENTS
OCCURRED. REGION 6985 (S17W42) PRODUCED AN M4/2B FLARE AT
30/2309Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A MAJOR TYPE II SWEEP (EST.
SHOCK VELOCITY 2500 KM/SEC) AND A 280 SFU TENFLARE. THIS REGION
DISPLAYED GRADUAL DECAY DURING THE DAY. THERE WERE THREE
OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M-CLASS X-RAY BURSTS: AN M4 AT 31/0325Z,
AN M2 AT 31/0753Z, AND AN M1 AT 31/1028Z. REGION 6988 (S16W22)
PRODUCED THE FINAL M-CLASS EVENT OF THE PERIOD: AN M2/1N FLARE
AT 31/1551Z. THIS REGION SHOWED GROWTH IN MAGNETIC FIELD
STRENGTH AND COMPLEXITY. REGION 6982 (S15W86) DISPLAYED MINOR
SURGING AS IT BEGAN TO CROSS THE WEST LIMB, BUT PRODUCED NO
FLARES DURING THE PERIOD. TWO NEWLY NUMBERED REGIONS CROSSED THE
EAST LIMB EARLY IN THE PERIOD: 6993 (S09E68) AND 6994 (S14E73).
THESE REGIONS ARE VERTICALLY STACKED AND APPEAR TO BE
INTERACTING IN THE FORM OF OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION.
LIMB PROXIMITY PREVENTS A CONCISE ANALYSIS OF THE MORPHOLOGICAL
ASPECTS OF THIS REGION COMPLEX. NEW REGION 6995 (N09W31) WAS
ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6985, 6988, 6993, AND 6994 MAY
PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES. REGION 6988 MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN
ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST DAY. ACTIVITY IS
EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE SECOND DAY
IN RESPONSE TO THE M4/2B FLARE OF 30/2309Z. ACTIVITY SHOULD
SUBSIDE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE FINAL DAY.
