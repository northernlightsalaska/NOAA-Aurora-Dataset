IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE X-RAY BACKGROUND
HAS BEEN ENHANCED WELL ABOVE C CLASS LEVEL SINCE YESTERDAY.
THIS ENHANCEMENT IS MOSTLY DUE TO THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT IN

IT HAS PRODUCED ONLY A FEW SUBFLARES SINCE ITS ARRIVAL AT THE
EAST LIMB.  REGION 6445 (S17W16) WAS ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE IS POSSIBLE IN
REGION 6442 IF DEVELOPMENT IN THIS REGION CONTINUES.
