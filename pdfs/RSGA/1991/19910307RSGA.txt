JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 066 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. THE PREMIER EVENT OF
THE DAY WAS AN X5/3B FLARE FROM REGION 6538 (S25E61) AT 0755Z.
A 3000 FLUX UNIT TENFLARE, TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS, AND A LARGE
LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM ACCOMPANIED THIS ACTIVITY. FIVE
OPTICALLY CORRELATED M-FLARES WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THIS
AREA, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS AN M5/SF EVENT AT 1405Z.
CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS FROM THIS AREA CONTINUED TO INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY IN INTENSITY TODAY. REGION 6537 (S08E42) SHOWED
SLIGHT SPOT GROWTH WHILE CONTRIBUTING AN M2/1N FLARE AT 0930Z
AND AN M2/1B EVENT AT 1721Z. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE FROM
DEPARTED REGION 6533 (S23, L-150) MAY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF
THE UNCORRELATED M3 X-RAY ENHANCEMENT GENERATED AT 1259Z.
REGION 6536 (N18E42) REMAINED STABLE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
NEW REGIONS 6541 (N18E07) AND 6542 (S11E67) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. MORE M-CLASS FLARES ARE LIKELY FROM REGION
6538 WHICH MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN ISOLATED X-CLASS EVENT.
M-CLASS FLARING IS ALSO POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS 6536 AND 6537.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS WITH PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING NOTED
AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE IN RESPONSE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS AT
THE START OF THE PERIOD WITH THE TREND TOWARDS UNSETTLED TO
SLIGHTLY ACTIVE LEVELS THEREAFTER.
