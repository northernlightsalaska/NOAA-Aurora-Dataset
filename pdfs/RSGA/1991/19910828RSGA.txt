JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 240 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6785 (N11W94)
PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS FLARES WHILE CROSSING THE LIMB. THE FIRST
WAS AN M1/SF AT 27/2321Z AND THE SECOND AN M4/SF AT 28/1603Z.
A BRIGHT SURGE EXTENDING TO 0.53 SOLAR RADII WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE M4 FLARE. REGION 6805 (N24E24) DISPLAYED MODERATE GROWTH IN
ITS TRAILER, BUT ALSO DISPLAYED MINOR DECAY IN ITS LEADER.
HOWEVER, ITS INTERIOR PENUMBRAL MASS, WHEREIN THE DELTA MAGNETIC
STRUCTURE LIES, SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE DURING THE PERIOD.
THE REGION PRODUCED SIX FLARES DURING THE PERIOD, THE LARGEST OF
WHICH WAS A C6/1B AT 28/1951Z. REGION 6807 (S08E20) DISPLAYED A
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SPOT COUNT. NEW REGION 6811 (S19E65) WAS
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6805 IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY
AND ALSO POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE PERIOD BEGAN WITH MINOR STORMING,
BUT DECLINED TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS BY 28/0300Z. ANOTHER
INCREASE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES AT
28/1800Z. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT ENDED AT
28/2005Z. THE ASSOCIATED POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT ENDED AT
28/1225Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE LEVELS WITH MINOR STORMING POSSIBLE
AT HIGH LATITUDES BASED UPON THE 27 DAY RECURRENT PATTERN AND
A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE. THE CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS
ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN ON 30 AUGUST AND CONTINUE FOR ABOUT
THREE DAYS.
