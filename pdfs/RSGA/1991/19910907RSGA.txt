JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 250 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 SEP 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6818 (S12W52)
CONTINUED ITS RAPID GROWTH DURING THE DAY AND PRODUCED A
NUMBER OF ENERGETIC FLARES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH REGION 6811
(S21W67), IT GENERATED AN X3/2B TENFLARE WITH TYPE II SWEEP AT
1927Z, WHILE 6811 HAD A SIMULTANEOUS 1N FLARE. REGION 6818 ALSO
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR; AN M4/2N AT 1007Z, AN M2/2B AT 1250Z, AN
M2/1B AT 0751Z, AND AN M1/0F AT 1833Z. THE REGION MORE THAN
DOUBLED IN SPOT AREA AND IS COMPLEX MAGNETICALLY. ELSEWHERE,
TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED, 6821 (S11E05) AND 6822 (S06E71).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6818, NOW A MATURE ACTIVE REGION, IS
LIKELY TO CONTINUE ENERGETIC ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED. THE GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTON ENHANCEMENT ENDED AROUND 1200Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY, THEN AT ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGH THE END OF THE INTERVAL. FILAMENT
DISAPPEARANCES ON 4-5 SEPT., TODAY'S X3 FLARE, AND A FAVORABLY
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE MAY ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELEVATED
ACTIVITY.
