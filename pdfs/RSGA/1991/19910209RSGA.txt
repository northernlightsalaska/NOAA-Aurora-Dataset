JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 040 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 FEB 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6487 (N14E14)
REMAINED MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX WHILE CONTINUING A GRADUAL RATE OF
GROWTH. IT PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES, ONE OF WHICH REACHED
C-CLASS. FOUR NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED: 6490 (S07E24), 6491
(S05E65), 6492 (S13E13), AND 6493 (S21E20). REGION 6491 EMERGED
AS AN A-TYPE, BUT QUICKLY GREW TO A D-TYPE. HOWEVER, NO FLARE
ACTIVITY OCCURRED WITHIN THE REGION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6487 MAY PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY,
GIVEN ITS DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR STORMING OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES
LATE IN THE PERIOD. THE ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS MAY BE
DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. HOWEVER, BRIEF PERIODS OF
ACTIVE LEVELS MAY OCCUR DURING THE FIRST DAY DUE TO CORONAL
HOLE EFFECTS.
