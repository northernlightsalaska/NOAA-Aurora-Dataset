JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 081 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6555 (S23E17)
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO MAJOR FLARES AND THREE OTHER LOW LEVEL
M-CLASS EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD. THE FIRST MAJOR FLARE WAS AN
M5/2B TENFLARE AT 21/2344Z. MODERATE RADIO BURSTS AND A UNIQUE
TYPE IV RADIO SWEEP WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FLARE. THE TYPE IV
SWEEP WAS OF AN INTENSITY AND DURATION RARELY SEEN. THE SECOND
MAJOR FLARE WAS AN M6/1B TENFLARE AT 22/0840Z. REGION 6555
ALSO PRODUCED A LONG DURATION M2 WHICH REMAINS IN PROGRESS
AT THIS TIME. REGION 6545 (S07W85) CONTINUED ITS DECAY
TODAY BUT DID MANAGE TO PRODUCE A LONG DURATION M3/SB AT
22/0606Z. SURGING, SUBFLARES, AND GROWTH WERE OBSERVED IN
REGION 6558 (S14E61) AS IT ROTATED FARTHER INTO VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6555 WILL CONTINUE AS THE THREAT FOR
HIGH ACTIVITY. REGIONS 6445 AND 6558 MAY ADD AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED THE PAST 24
HOURS. SEVERAL PERIODS OF MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE
REPORTED AT HIGH LATITUDES AT 0900-1200Z. ACTIVITY HAS
RETURNED TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED AT ALL LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. THE UNIQUE TYPE IV RADIO
SWEEP OBSERVED TODAY IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
A CORONAL MASS EJECTION WHICH WOULD CAUSE GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY.
