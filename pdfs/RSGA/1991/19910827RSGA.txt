JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 239 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES
WERE OBSERVED. THE LARGEST WAS A C8/SF AT 27/1922Z FROM REGION
6805 (N24E37). THIS REGION REMAINED MODERATELY COMPLEX IN
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE, BUT WAS FAIRLY STABLE. NO NEW REGIONS WERE
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6805 IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY
AND ALSO POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER RECORDED
A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 17 NANOTESLA AT 27/1515Z. THE GREATER
THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT THAT BEGAN AT 26/1740Z REACHED A
PRELIMINARY MAXIMUM OF 240 PFU AT 27/1830Z AND WAS IN
PROGRESS AS THE PERIOD ENDED. AN ASSOCIATED POLAR CAP
ABSORPTION EVENT COMMENCED AT 27/0646Z, REACHED AN ESTIMATED
PRELIMINARY MAXIMUM OF 4.7 DB (DAYTIME) AT 27/1830Z, AND WAS
IN PROGRESS AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. ALL OF THE ABOVE
ACTIVITY WAS PROBABLY IN RESPONSE TO THE X2/2B FLARE THAT
OCCURRED AT 25/0115Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE WITH MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
POSSIBLE AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE PROTON AND POLAR CAP
ABSORPTION EVENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST, POSSIBLY THROUGH
29 AUGUST.
