JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 355 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. TWO OPTICALLY UN-
CORRELATED M-CLASS EVENTS OCCURRED TODAY: AN M1 AT 1208Z AND
AN M1 AT 1822Z. AN ADDITIONAL UNCORRELATED C9.8 OCCURRED AT
0425Z. REGION 6972 (S08W04) SHOWED SLOW DECAY AND PRODUCED
A C7/SF AT 1526Z. REGION 6966 (S03W87) COULD ONLY PRODUCE A
C5/SF AT 0820Z AS IT CROSSED THE WEST LIMB. REGION 6982
(S14E43) WAS NOT OBSERVED TO PRODUCE ANY FLARES BUT DID
SHOW CONTINUED GROWTH IN A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA MAGNETIC CON-
FIGURATION. A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM WAS REPORTED ON EAST
LIMB AT S16 NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT SOURCE OF M-FLARES IS UNKNOWN,
REGION 6982 SHOWS CLEAR CAPABILITY FOR PRODUCING M-FLARES AND
POSSIBLY AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE. REGION 6972 CONTINUES TO BE
RESPECTABLE AND MIGHT PRODUCE AN M-CLASS EVENT AS WELL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOME PERIODS
OF ISOLATED MINOR STORMING WERE REPORTED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
THE INCREASE IS PROBABLY A RESULT OF CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE LEVELS AT MID-LATITUDES AND AT ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS
AS A RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR FLARE OF 20 DECEMBER. THE DISTUR-
BANCE SHOULD SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE THIRD
DAY.
