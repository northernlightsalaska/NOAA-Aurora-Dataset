JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 049 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 FEB 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THREE M-CLASS EVENTS
OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD, BUT JUST ONE HAD A CLEAR OPTICAL
COUNTERPART. REGION 6504 (S16E36) PRODUCED AN M2/1N AT 0730Z.
THE LAST TWO EVENTS, AN M1 AT 1729Z AND ANOTHER AT 2057Z, WERE
WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT PARENT H-ALPHA FLARE. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT
THEY COULD HAVE COME FROM BEYOND EAST LIMB, BUT THAT IS MERELY
SPECULATION AT THIS WRITING. A BAND OF PREVIOUSLY ACTIVE
LONGITUDES IS NOW COMING ONTO THE VISIBLE DISK, AS TODAY'S
INCREASE OF 53 FLUX UNITS IN THE 10.7 CM. FLUX WILL ATTEST.
REGION 6509 (S20E70) IS ONE OF THE EASTERN ACTIVE CENTERS AND
IS CURRENTLY THE LARGEST REGION OF THE SIXTEEN NOW VISIBLE.
NEWLY ASSIGNED REGION 6511 (S23W79) WAS BORN ON THE DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. M-CLASS IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE FROM EITHER ONE OF
THE SPOT GROUPS NOW NEAR THE EAST LIMB - 6509 OR AN AS YET
UNNUMBERED REGION NEARBY - OR FROM REGION 6504. THERE IS A
DISTINCT CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARE OCCURRING DURING
THE INTERVAL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
