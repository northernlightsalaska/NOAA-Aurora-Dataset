JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 363 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6982 (S13W61)
PRODUCED BACK TO BACK M-FLARES VERY EARLY IN THE PERIOD. THE
FIRST WAS A VERY IMPULSIVE M7/1B AT 29/2111Z THAT HAD AN
ASSOCIATED 620 SFU TENFLARE. THIS WAS QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY A LONG
DURATION SUBBRIGHT FLARE THAT GRADUALLY REACHED A MAXIMUM OF
M2.7 AT 29/2323Z. A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM ACCOMPANIED THIS
FLARE. THIS REGION SIMPLIFIED SOMEWHAT IN MAGNETIC STRUCTURE AND
PRODUCED TWO C-CLASS SUBFLARES DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE
PERIOD. REGION 6985 (S16W17) ALSO DISPLAYED A GRADUAL DECREASE
IN COMPLEXITY AND PRODUCED NO FLARES. NEW REGION 6992 (S13E20)
WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6982 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE OCCASIONAL
M-CLASS FLARES AND MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
REGIONS 6985 AND 6988 (S15E04) MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE HIGH LATITUDES
RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO STORM LEVELS. THE STORMING OCCURRED
FROM 29/0900-1200Z AND MAY HAVE BEEN CORONAL HOLE RELATED.
AN ENHANCEMENT IN THE SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON FLUX AT GREATER
THAN 10 MEV BEGAN NEAR 29/0400Z AND REMAINED IN PROGRESS,
THOUGH VERY GRADUALLY DECLINING, DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE
PERIOD. THIS ENHANCEMENT PROBABLY RESULTED FROM THE LONG
DURATION M2 FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE TOMORROW INCREASING TO
MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE SECOND DAY (WITH STORMING POSSIBLE
AT HIGH LATITUDES) AS A RESULT OF THE LONG DURATION M2 FLARE.
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY DECLINE TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS DURING THE THIRD DAY. THE PROTON ENHANCEMENT IS
EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO BACKGROUND LEVELS TOMORROW.
