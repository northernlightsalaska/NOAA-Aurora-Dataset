JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 321 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 NOV 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. NEWLY NUMBERED REGION
6929 (S10E74) - FORMERLY 6891 - PRODUCED TWO M CLASS EVENTS, AN
M1/0F AT 0716Z AND A VERY IMPULSIVE M1/2B TENFLARE AT 1834Z. THE
SECOND FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN IMPRESSIVE SPRAY VISIBLE TO
AT LEAST .56 SOLAR RADII. LIMB PROXIMITY PROHIBITS A THOROUGH
ANALYSIS OF THE REGION, BUT IT CLEARLY POSSESSES AT LEAST SOME
DEGREE OF POTENCY. REGION 6919 (S12W44) YIELDED AN M1/2B
TENFLARE OF ITS OWN WITH TYPE II SWEEP AT 0201Z. SLOW DECAY HAS
BEEN REPORTED THERE. NEW REGION 6928 (S16E36) WAS BORN ON THE
DISK. TWO FILAMENTS DISAPPEARED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, ONE 12
DEGREE-LONG FROM S10E36, AND ANOTHER 21 DEGREES IN LENGTH FROM
N43E61.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6929 SHOULD CONTINUE ITS M CLASS FLARES AND
REGION 6919 MAY CONTRIBUTE ACTIVITY ALSO.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS THE
PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE THE NEXT 24 HOURS WHEN EFFECTS FROM
THE MAJOR FLARE OF 15 NOV ARE DUE. UNSETTLED TO MILDLY
ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD END THE PERIOD.
