JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 275 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6850 (S11W21)
PRODUCED JUST ONE M-CLASS FLARE, AN M1/1B AT 01/2250Z. ITS
NEARBY NEIGHBOR, REGION 6853 (S21E03), ALSO HAD BUT ONE M-CLASS
FLARE, AN M1/0N AT 0127Z. BOTH REGIONS ARE LESS IMPRESSIVE THAN
YESTERDAY AND THEIR FLARE FREQUENCY HAS SLOWED ALSO. REGION
6850 IS STILL THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLEX REGION ON THE DISK
AS ATTESTED BY ITS AREA OF ABOUT 1500 MILLIONTHS AND ITS BETA-
GAMMA DELTA MAGNETIC CLASSIFICATION. REGION 6855 (N18E07) HAS
GROWN IN WHITE LIGHT WHILE PRODUCING A FEW SUBFLARES. THE OTHER
FIVE DISK REGIONS HAVE NOT BEEN A FACTOR.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. OCCASIONAL LOW LEVEL M-CLASS EVENTS ARE ANTICIPATED
FROM REGIONS 6850 AND 6853.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY MINOR TO MAJOR
STORM LEVELS SINCE THE SUDDEN COMMENCEMENT OF 01/1815Z.
DISAPPEARING FILAMENT AND/OR FLARE ACTIVITY OF THE PAST FEW
DAYS IS THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE STORM. THE MODEST GREATER
THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT ENDED AT 01/2315Z WITH THE PEAK FLUX
A MERE 12 PFU, AT 01/1810Z AND AGAIN AT 01/1850Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT 24
HOURS. EPISODES OF MAJOR STORMING MAY BE OBSERVED NEAR LOCAL
MIDNIGHT. THE DISTURBANCE SHOULD WEAKEN WITH TIME, AND
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO CLOSE THE FORE-
CAST PERIOD.
