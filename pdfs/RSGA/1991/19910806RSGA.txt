JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 218 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6757 (N23W50)
REIGNED SUPREME PRODUCING VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PERIODS X-RAY
EVENTS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS AN M1/1B FLARE AT 06/0444Z.
THE REGION CONTINUED TO EXHIBIT FRAGMENTATION IN ITS TRAILING
SPOT AREA ALONG WITH SIMPLIFICATION OF ITS MAGNETIC STRUCTURE.
REGION 6758 (S16W50) SHOWED LITTLE CHANGE IN SIZE DURING THE
PAST 24 HOURS. THE REGION HAS HOWEVER, DISPLAYED AN INCREASE
IN SUBFLARE PRODUCTION. ISOLATED SUBFLARING WAS NOTED FROM
REGION 6749 (S17, L-277) WHICH HAS SINCE ROUNDED THE WEST LIMB.
NEW REGIONS 6770 (N09E70) AND 6771 (S06W45) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6757 CONTINUES TO DOMINATE, PROVIDING THE
BEST SOURCE FOR ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. A MINOR STORM BEGAN AT 05/2045Z WITH THE ARRIVAL OF
A 25 NANOTESLA SSC AS MEASURED ON THE BOULDER MAGNETOMETER.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE WITH PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING AT THE
START OF THE PERIOD. UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS
SHOULD PREVAIL BY THE 9TH.
