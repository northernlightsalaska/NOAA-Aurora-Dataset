JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 073 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED AT THE HIGH LEVEL.
REGION 6545 (S09E23), STILL THE DOMINANT ACTIVE CENTER,
YIELDED AN X1/1B TENFLARE WITH IMPORTANCE 3 TYPE IV AT 1816Z.
PARALLEL RIBBONS AND UMBRAL COVERAGE WERE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE EVENT. THIS FLARE WAS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY AN M2/SN
AT 1741Z. THE REGION'S FLARE RATE HAS FALLEN FROM ITS OUTPUT OF
YESTERDAY, BUT IT STILL REMAINS OMINOUS IN WHITE LIGHT AND
H-ALPHA. REGION 6538 (S23W31) IS STILL LARGE AND DISORGANIZED,
BUT IT GENERATED JUST TWO SUBFLARES.TWO NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED: 6547 (S08E45) AND 6548 (S12E68).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. REGION 6545 STILL HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR CONTINUED
X-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
BOTH THE FORBUSH DECREASE AND THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON
ENHANCEMENT CONTINUE, ALTHOUGH THE PROTON FLUX HAS DECLINED
SLIGHTLY FROM YESTERDAY'S VALUES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
FEW DAYS. THIS FLARE-INDUCED DISTURBANCE IS LIKELY TO
EVENTUATE DUE TO RECENT MAJOR FLARES FROM REGION 6545. THE
PROSPECTS OF AN INTERPLANETARY SHOCK BOOSTING THE GREATER
THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUX TO EVENT LEVELS ARE GOOD.
