JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 160 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 6659 (N31W06)
PRODUCED ANOTHER MAJOR FLARE, AN X10/3B AT 0143UT.  THIS EVENT
WAS ACCOMPAINED BY TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS AND RELATIVELY STRONG
BURSTS AT HIGH FREQUENCIES, EG 26,000SFU AT 15400MHZ.  MATERIAL
WAS REPORTED MOVING TO THE NW OF THE REGION AND LOOPS WERE SEEN.
A LARGE DARK BUSHY FILAMENT IS PRESENT ALONG EASTERN SIDE OF
REGION.  REGION 6659 IS SLOWLY ROTATING CCW RESULTING IN A
CHANGING MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION.  DELTAS ARE STILL PRESENT.
IN ADDITION TO THE X10, FOUR SMALL M FLARES WERE OBSERVED IN
THE PAST 24 HOURS, ALL FROM REGION 6659.  REGION 6666 (S15E01)
CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AND IS NOW AN EXTENDED BETA GAMMA GROUP.
SMALL SURGES WERE OBSERVED NEAR SE20 WHERE A SMALL PLAGE HAS
ROTATED ON TO THE DISK.  REGION 6672 (N15E44) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  ADDITIONAL MAJOR FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM
REGION 6659.  M FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM REGION 6666.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  A SUDDEN IMPULSE (114 GAMMAS AT
BOULDER) WAS OBSERVED AT 0040UT, PROBABLY FROM THE M4 FLARE
FROM REGION 6659 ON 7 JUNE.  ANOTHER SI (15 GAMMAS AT
BOULDER) WAS OBSERVED AT 1615UT.  THE SATELLITE PROTON EVENT
AND PCA CONTINUE WITH FLUXES SLOWLY DECREASING (CURRENT P10
FLUX IS 65PFU).  THE X10 FLARE MENTIONED IN PART IA DID NOT
PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ENERGETIC PARTICLES AT
EARTH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT STORM LEVELS EARLY IN THE PERIOD, DECLINING
TO ACTIVE LEVELS LATE IN THE PERIOD.  THE EFFECTS FROM THE X10
FLARE MENTIONED IN PART IA SHOULD BE FELT SOMETIME ON 10 JUNE.
THE SATELLITE PROTON EVENT AND PCA ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.
