JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 276 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6853 (S20W25)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE: AN M1/1N AT 0150Z. THIS
MATURE GROUP IS LINKED CLOSELY WITH ITS LARGE NEIGHBOR 6850
(S12W32), AND THESE TWO GROUPS CURRENTLY DOMINATE THE DISK
IN SIZE, COMPLEXITY AND FLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 6850 CONTINUES
TO SPORT SEVERAL DELTA CONFIGURATIONS SHOWING STRONG MAGNETIC
FIELDS AND GRADIENTS. THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE GROUPS ALSO
RESULTS IN AN ONGOING INTERACTION BETWEEN THEM. THERE WAS SOME
INDICATION OF SLIGHT FLUX DECAY IN BOTH OF THESE REGIONS. REGION
6861 (N09E20) GREW TO A MATURE GROUP D-TYPE GROUP TODAY AND PRO-
DUCED A C3/SF AT 2028Z. REGION 6855 (N18W06) ALSO SHOWED SOME
GROWTH TODAY. A NEW H-TYPE GROUP ROTATED INTO VIEW AT S17E65 AND
WAS ASSIGNED 6863.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6850 AND 6853 SHOW MANY CHARACTER-
ISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR FLARE PRODUCING REGIONS AND ARE
LIKELY TO PRODUCE SUCH AN EVENT SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. IN ADDITION THE GROWTH IN 6861 SHOULD HELP KEEP ACTIVITY
UP TO AT LEAST MODERATE LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS INITIALLY AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS
WITH OCCASIONAL MINOR STORM PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM
THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY UNTIL AROUND 1200Z. CONDITIONS
SUBSIDED TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE DAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. AN IN-
CREASE IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND DAY OR
PERHAPS THE THIRD DAY AS A CORONAL HOLE ON THE SOLAR DISK RO-
TATES INTO A FAVORABLE POSITION. GENERALLY ACTIVE LEVELS WITH
OCCASIONAL MINOR STORM PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES ARE EXPECTED
AT THAT TIME.
