JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 300 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY PERSISTED AT THE HIGH LEVEL.
REGION 6891 (S11E07) CONTINUED ITS BARRAGE OF MAJOR FLARES WITH
AN X6/3B TENFLARE (3800 SFU) WITH TYPES II AND IV AT 0548Z THE
MOST DRAMATIC. THE TYPE IV SWEEP LASTED NEARLY 5 HOURS. THE
REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN X1/2B AT 0212Z, AN M2/1N WITH TYPE IV AT
0035Z, AND AN M3/1N TENFLARE (410 SFU) AT 1301Z. RELATIVE QUIET
HAS PREVAILED SINCE THIS LAST FLARE, BUT THE REGION IS STILL
HOT AND LARGE. ITS NEUTRAL LINE FILAMENTS SEEM TO BE EVEN MORE
TWISTED AND FRAYED TODAY, GIVING THE REGION A GNARLY LOOK.
NEARBY NEIGHBOR REGION 6892 (S20E08), SHARING A COMMON NEUTRAL
LINE WITH 6891, GREW WHILE YIELDING AN OCCASIONAL FLARE. REGION
6893 (N17E31) HAD A C9/1N AT1738Z. ONE NEW REGION WAS BORN ON
THE DISK, 6897 (S18W21).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE REGION
6891 HAS ITS NEXT MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS AT ALL LATITUDES DURING THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS.
THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURBANCE MAY BE A COMBINATION OF FLARE
AND CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON
FLUXES HAVE BEEN UNAFFECTED BY THE RECENT MAJOR SOLAR FLARES.
PROTON PREDICTION MODELS HAD FORECAST LARGE FLUX ENHANCEMENTS
FROM THE LAST THREE X-CLASS FLARES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD. YESTERDAY'S X1/2N FLARE AND TODAY'S X6/3B FLARE, BOTH
WITH TYPES II AND IV, ARE LIKELY TO PROLONG THE CURRENT DIST-
URBANCE. EPISODES OF MAJOR STORMING ARE PROBABLE DURING LOCAL
NIGHTTIMES.
