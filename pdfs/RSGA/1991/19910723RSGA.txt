JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 204 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6739 (N0WE41)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE: AN M1/SF AT 1759Z. THE
GROUP HAS SHOWN GROWTH OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS. REGION 6741
(N10E39) ALMOST PRODUCED AN M-FLARE (ACTUALLY A C9/1F) AT
2027Z. THIS REGION HAS SHOWN REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT DURING
THE DAY AND IT PRODUCED NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL SMALL FLARES
DURING THE PERIOD. THERE APPEARS TO BE THE BEGINNING OF A
DELTA FORMING IN THE REGION. REGION 6734 (N09E23) CONTINUES
TO DOMINATE THE DISK IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY WITH CONTINUING
GROWTH AND STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS AND GRADIENTS. NONETHELESS
IT COULD PRODUCE ONLY SMALL C-CLASS FLARES DURING THE PERIOD.
REGIONS 6736 (S10W04) AND 6737 (S15E21) ALSO SHOWED SOME
GROWTH TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH CONTRIBUTIONS POSSIBLE FROM 6734, 6737, 6739 OR
6741. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A FAIR CHANCE FOR ISOLATED MAJOR
FLARE ACTIVITY FROM REGION 6734.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH OCCASIONAL
PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE PARTWAY THROUGH TOMORROW,
AFTER WHICH ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO
BEGIN. THIS INCREASE IS EXPECTED AS A RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR
FLARE OF 22 JULY, AND IS EXPECTED TO LAST THROUGH THE SECOND
DAY. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY ACTIVE
LEVELS BY DAY THREE.
