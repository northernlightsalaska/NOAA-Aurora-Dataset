JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 092 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. SEVERAL OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED X-RAY EVENTS WERE NOTED TODAY, THE LARGEST OF
WHICH WAS AN M1 EVENT AT 01/2134Z. A C2 X-RAY EVENT OBSERVED
AT 02/1050Z WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG TYPE II SWEEP AND A
400 FLUX UNIT TENFLARE. ONLY ISOLATED SUBFLARING WAS NOTED FROM
REGIONS 6562 (N14E02) AND 6565 (N10E31). REGION 6563 (S10E05)
REMAINED STABLE. A 14 DEGREE LONG SEGMENT OF DARK FILAMENT
DISAPPEARED NEAR S34W48 BETWEEN 01/1530Z AND 01/2120Z. NEW
REGION 6566 (S25E71) WAS ASSIGNED. IT CURRENTLY CONTAINS ONLY A
SIMPLE SPOT GROUP HOWEVER STRONG CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS FROM THIS
LOCATION SUGGEST MORE MAY FOLLOW. THIS GROUP APPEARS TO BE THE
REMAINS OF OLD REGION 6538 (S23, L-343) WHICH PRODUCED NUMEROUS
MAJOR FLARES DURING ITS LAST ROTATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN M-CLASS FLARE EXISTS FROM
THE REGIONS CURRENTLY ON THE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD CONTINUED TO RUN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS TODAY WITH SOME MINOR STORMING AT HIGH LATITUDES. A
SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON ENHANCEMENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV
RESULTED IN A TENTATIVE PEAK OF 3 PFU AT 02/1030Z. THE SOURCE
OF THIS ENHANCEMENT WAS NOT DETERMINED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT THE
START OF THE PERIOD IN RESPONSE TO RESIDUAL EFFECTS FROM
THE MAJOR FLARING NOTED ON THE 29TH. PERIODS OF ACTIVE
CONDITIONS SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE 4TH AS A WELL
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE BEGINS TO AFFECT THE FIELD.
