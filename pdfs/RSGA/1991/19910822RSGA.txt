JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 234 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  REGION 6786 (S09W29)
PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 22/0553Z.  THIS REGION HAS DECAYED SLIGHTLY
SINCE YESTERDAY BUT STILL REMAINS ONE OF THE LARGER REGIONS ON
THE DISK.  REGION 6781 (S17W45) IS THE LARGEST AND POSSIBLY THE
MOST COMPLEX REGION ON THE DISK BUT HAS PRODUCED ONLY SMALL
FLARES DURING THE PAST DAY.  REGIONS 6782 (S09W44) AND
6784 (S20W62) REMAIN SOMEWHAT COMPLEX AND HAVE ALSO PRODUCED
A FEW SMALL SUBFLARES.  NEW REGIONS 6802 (S20E14) AND
6803 (S09E83) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES ARE POSSIBLE IN
REGIONS 6782, 6784, AND 6786.  REGION 6781 MAY YET PRODUCE A
MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT UNSETTLED TO STORM LEVELS.  MOST
OF THE ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PERSISTENT STORM IS
OCCURRING DURING LOCAL NIGHTIME.  THE SOLAR SOURCE OF THIS STORM
IS STILL NOT CLEARLY DEFINED, HOWEVER FILAMENT ACTIVITY MAY BE
THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
