JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 104 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. NEW REGION 6593
(S11E70) ROTATED INTO VIEW WITH STRONG SURGING ON THE LIMB AND
PRODUCED AN M1/SF AT 1303Z. REGION 6582 (S25E03) PRODUCED
TODAY'S OTHER M-FLARE: AN M1/2N AT 0400Z. THIS REGION SHOWED
SOME GROWTH AND HAS A BETA-GAMMA CONFIGURATION. REGION 6583
(N09E21) IS THE LARGEST (910 MILLIONTHS), MOST COMPLICATED
GROUP ON THE DISK WITH A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA CONFIGURATION. THE
REGION SHOWED CONTINUED GROWTH DURING THE DAY BUT ONLY PRODUCED
A COUPLE SUBFLARES. REGION 6580 (N28W22), ANOTHER MAGNETIC
DELTA GROUP, APPEARED TO BE RELAXING IN INTENSITY AND WAS FLARE
QUIET. REGIONS 6570 (N06W48) AND 6592 (N13E47) BOTH SHOWED
MODEST GROWTH TODAY. NEW REGION 6594 (S19E21) WAS ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6583 IS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR M-CLASS OR
GREATER ACTIVITY AS IT APPEARS TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR
DEVELOPING MAGNETIC SHEAR. REGION 6593 MIGHT ALSO MAKE A
CONTRIBUTION. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR
FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED TOMORROW, BECOMING MOSTLY
UNSETTLED ON THE SECOND DAY AND PARTWAY THROUGH THE THIRD DAY.
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON THE THIRD DAY
IN RESPONSE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
