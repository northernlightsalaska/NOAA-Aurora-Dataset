JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 295 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. A SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN ENERGETIC ACTIVITY AND 10.7CM FLUX HAILED THE
ARRIVAL OF NEW REGION 6891 (S10E73). ALTHOUGH THE LARGE, COMPLEX
SPOT AREA ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVE CENTER HAS BARELY ROTATED
INTO VIEW, IT HAS ALREADY PRODUCED A PAIR OF M-CLASS EVENTS:
AN M1/1F FLARE AT 0644Z AND AN M1/1N FLARE AT 1902Z. THIS REGION
MARKS THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 6850 (S12, L-179) WHICH PRODUCED
A HOST OF FLARES DURING ITS LAST TRANSIT. ALSO ASSIGNED TODAY
WAS NEW REGION 6892 (S17E74). THIS APPEARS TO BE THE REMNANTS OF
RETURNING OLD REGION 6853 (S20, L-174), AN AREA WHICH ALSO HAS A
HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT FLARE PRODUCTION. OTHER ACTIVITY OF NOTE
INCLUDED AN ISOLATED SUBFLARE FROM REGION 6879 (N23W39).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. NEW REGION 6891 POSES THE GREATEST THREAT FOR M-CLASS
FLARE PRODUCTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
WITH PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE WITH PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING
AT HIGH LATITUDES DUE TO EFFECTS FROM A CORONAL HOLE.
