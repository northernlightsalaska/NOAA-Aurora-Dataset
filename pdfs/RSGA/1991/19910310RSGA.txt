A NOTABLE DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. ISOLATED SUBFLARING WAS
OBSERVED FROM REGION 6537 (S08E01) WHICH DISPLAYS SOME INCREASE
IN MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. NEW REGION 6545 (S08E79) WAS ASSIGNED.
THIS AREA PRODUCED A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM AT 09/2224Z.

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
WITH BRIEF PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING OBSERVED. A SUDDEN
IMPULSE MEASURING 33 NANOTESLAS WAS OBSERVED AT BOULDER
USGS AT 09/2246Z. THE SHOCK IS BELIEVED TO BE IN RESPONSE
TO THE MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY OBSERVED ON THE 7TH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE WITH THE TREND TOWARDS UNSETTLED LEVELS.
