JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 360 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGIONS 6982 (S13W21)
AND 6985 (S15E23) CONTINUED TO PRODUCE LOW-LEVEL M-CLASS FLARES.
BOTH REGIONS REMAIN LARGE AND COMPLEX, WITH 6982 POSSIBLY THE
MOST SIGNIFICANT REGION. THE DELTA CONFIGURATION PERSISTS IN
6982 AND THE SHEAR NEAR THE DELTA APPEARS TO BE INCREASING.
REGION 6985 NO LONGER HAS A DELTA AND THE OVERALL APPEARANCE
OF THE REGION SUGGESTS THAT IT IS SIMPLIFYING.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. MAJOR FLARES ARE POSSIBLE IN REGIONS 6982 AND
6985.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
