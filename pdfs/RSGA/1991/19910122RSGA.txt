JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 022 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THE PERIOD WAS
CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT FLARING. REGION 6455 (S13W76) WAS
VERY ACTIVE PRODUCING AN M3/1N FLARE AT 22/0550Z, AN M2/1F
FLARE AT 22/1318Z, AND AN M2/2N FLARE AT 22/1952Z. REGION
6462 (S17E55) PRODUCED AN M3/SN EVENT AT 22/1527Z AND NUMEROUS
SUBFLARES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. GROWTH IN THIS REGION, COUPLED
WITH ITS INTERACTION WITH REGION 6466 (S09E64) TO THE NORTH,
SHOULD PROVIDE A GOOD SOURCE FOR CONTINUED M-FLARE PRODUCTION.
STRONG CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS CONTINUED TO BE OBSERVED ON THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB AND MAY BE HAILING THE RETURN OF OLD REGION
6442 (S11 L-146) WHICH IS DUE TO RETURN NEAR THAT AREA ON THE
24TH. NEW REGION 6467 (S19E03) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6455 (S13W76) AND 6462 (S17E55) ARE BOTH
CAPABLE OF M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
