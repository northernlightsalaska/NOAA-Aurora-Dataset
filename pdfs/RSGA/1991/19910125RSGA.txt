JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 025 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 25 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6471 (S10E74)
PRODUCED AN X10/SF TENFLARE AT 0635Z. ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
EVENT WERE TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS WITH STRONG DISCRETE RADIO
BURSTS. REGION DISPLAYS SPOT COMPLEXITY AS IT ROTATES OVER
THE EAST LIMB. TWO M1 FLARES (NO OPTICAL CORRELATIONS) WERE
OBSERVED AT 0150Z AND 0256Z. LOOPS WERE OBSERVED AT 0316Z ON
THE EAST LIMB AT S14E90, SO THERE IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT
REGION 6471 PRODUCED THE M1 FLARES. REGION 6466 (S08E23)
GENERATED AN M1/SN AT 1112Z AND AN M2/2N AT 1332Z. THIS REGION
DISPLAYS A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. REGION
6462 (S16E21) HAS PRODUCED NUMEROUS SUBFLARES AND CONTAINS A
BETA-GAMMA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6462, 6466 AND 6471 HAVE THE
COMPLEXITY TO PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES AND ISOLATED X-CLASS
FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THERE WAS ONE ACTIVE PERIOD
FROM 15-18Z AT MID LATITUDES AND ANOTHER ACTIVE PERIOD FROM
24/18-21Z AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE CAUSE OF THESE ACTIVE
CONDITIONS AT MID LATITUDES MAY BE FROM THE M3/SN FLARE ON
24 JAN AT 0355Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE ON THE FIRST AND THIRD DAYS WITH
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ON THE SECOND. EFFECTS FROM THE M3/SN
SHOULD GIVE US THE ACTIVE CONDITIONS ON JAN 26 WHILE THE
EFFECTS OF THE X10/SF MAY CAUSE ACTIVE CONDITIONS ON 28 JAN.
