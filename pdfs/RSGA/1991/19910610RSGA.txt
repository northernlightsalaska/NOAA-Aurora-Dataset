JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 161 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6659 (N31W18)
PRODUCED AN M6/1N FLARE AT 10/1358Z. THE FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY A 470 SFU TENFLARE AND A MAJOR TYPE II SWEEP. THIS REGION
ALSO PRODUCED THREE OTHER M-CLASS FLARES: AN M4/1N AT 10/0230Z
(ACCOMPANIED BY A 300 SFU TENFLARE), AN M1/1N AT 10/1105Z, AND
AN M3/SN AT 10/1659Z. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SPOT
NUMBER OR SIZE IN THE REGION, BUT IT REMAINED VERY COMPLEX IN
STRUCTURE. IT ALSO DISPLAYED CLOCKWISE ROTATION WHICH
CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED MAGNETIC SHEAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE
LEADING PORTION OF THE REGION. AN OPTICALLY UNASSOCIATED M1
OCCURRED AT 10/0445Z. REGION 6666 (S14W15) CONTINUED TO GROW AT
A GRADUAL RATE AND PRODUCED SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES THE LARGEST
OF WHICH WAS A C9/SF AT 10/0034Z. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. REGION 6659 IS EASILY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING OCCASIONAL
MAJOR FLARES. REGION 6666 MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ISOLATED PERIODS OF SEVERE
STORM LEVELS WERE NOTED AT BOTH MIDDLE AND HIGH LATITUDES.
THE DISTURBANCE BEGAN NEAR 10/0900Z AND WAS PROBABLY IN
RESPONSE TO THE X10/3B FLARE OF 09 JUNE. THE SATELLITE LEVEL
PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV CONTINUED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE FIRST
DAY DECLINING TO ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS ON THE SECOND
DAY. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED ON THE FINAL DAY.
THE PROTON EVENT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.
