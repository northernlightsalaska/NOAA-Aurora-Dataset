JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 095 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. SIX LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS
EVENTS WERE DETECTED. FOUR WERE UNCORRELATED. THE OTHER TWO
WERE ATTRIBUTED TO REGIONS 6562 (N16W37) AND 6563 (S11W35).
REGION 6562 HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX MAGNETICALLY
WHILE SHOWING SOME SPOT AREA GROWTH. CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS FROM
THE SOUTHEAST LIMB HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN INTENSITY SINCE
THE FIRST OF APRIL. THIS SUGGESTS THAT OLD REGION 6545 (S08,
L-289) WHICH PRODUCED NUMEROUS MAJOR EVENTS DURING ITS LAST
ROTATION AND IS DUE TO RETURN ON THE 6TH, LIKELY HAS DECAYED
CONSIDERABLY. NEW REGIONS ASSIGNED TODAY INCLUDE REGIONS
6571 (S11W07), 6572 (S19W04), 6573 (S49W05), AND 6574 (N27E54).
MAGNETIC ANALYSIS OF REGION 6573 INDICATES THE LEADING SPOT(S)
OF THIS REGION, THOUGH FORMING IN THE EXTREME SOUTH, ARE OF
POSITIVE POLARITY, HENCE THE CURRENT SOLAR CYCLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY LOW. ONLY AN ISOLATED CHANCE FOR M-CLASS FLARING
IS EXPECTED.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT
THE START OF THE PERIOD AND BETWEEN 0900-1500Z AT HIGH
LATITUDES. THE SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN
10 MEV APPEARS TO HAVE PEAKED AT 52 PFU ON 04/1000Z. FLUX
LEVELS HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE SINCE AND WERE RUNNING AT
10 PFU AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE. THE SATELLITE
LEVEL PROTON FLUX AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV SHOULD CONTINUE TO
DECLINE.
