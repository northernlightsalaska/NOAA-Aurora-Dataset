JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 362 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. NEW REGION 6991
(S10E81) PRODUCED AN M3 X-RAY BURST AT 28/1230Z AS IT ROUNDED
THE EAST LIMB. ACCOMPANYING THE BURST WAS A BRIGHT SURGE
REACHING 0.02 SOLAR RADII AND A 420 SFU TENFLARE. REGION 6982
(S14W48) WAS STABLE IN TERMS OF GROWTH, BUT REMAINED COMPLEX IN
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. IT PRODUCED FOUR FLARES THE LARGEST OF WHICH
WAS A C5/SF AT 28/1826Z. REGION 6985 (S17W03) ENTERED A GRADUAL
DECAY PHASE. REGION 6988 (S14E17) DISPLAYED MODERATE GROWTH IN
SPOT NUMBER AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6982 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES AND REMAINS CAPABLE OF ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.
REGIONS 6988 AND 6991 MAY ALSO PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE HIGH LATITUDE
FIELD VARIED FROM QUIET TO STORM LEVELS WITH THE STORMING
OBSERVED FROM 28/1200-2100Z. AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO CLEAR
SOURCE FOR THE STORMING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED.
