JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 305 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 NOV 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z: SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. NUMEROUS C-CLASS
FLARES WERE GENERATED DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 6891 (S11W60)
PRODUCED THE BULK OF THIS ACTIVITY, TO INCLUDE AN M1/SF FLARE AT
2029Z, WHILE CONTINUING TO DISPLAY SLIGHT DECAY IN ITS SPOTS
CONFIGURATION. THE AREA REMAINS POTENT MAGNETICALLY HOWEVER.
REGIONS 6892 (S18W59) AND 6893 (N17W38) ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE
NUMBER OF EVENTS OBSERVED. THESE AREAS ALSO SHOWED SIGNS OF SOME
DECAY IN PROGRESS. STRONG CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS WERE NOTED ON THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB IN THE VICINITY OF NEW REGION 6905 (S08E75).
THESE EMISSIONS WERE ALSO NOTED ON THE SOUTHWEST LIMB WHERE 6891
IS APPROACHING.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH REGIONS 6891, 6892, AND 6893 PROVIDING THE SOURCE
FOR FLARING AT THIS LEVEL. AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE IS STILL
POSSIBLE FROM 6891.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO SEVERE
STORM LEVELS. SEVERE STORMING WAS ISOLATED TO THE HIGH
LATITUDES WHILE MID-LATITUDES EXPERIENCED FREQUENT PERIODS OF
MAJOR STORMING. MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSINGS WERE OBSERVED BY THE
GOES 7 VEHICLE BETWEEN 01/1527-1617Z. CROSSING WERE ALSO NOTED
STARTING AT 2002Z. THIS TIME HOWEVER, THEY WERE OBSERVED ON BOTH
GOES VEHICLES. THE CURRENT ROUND OF STORMING MAY BE ASSOCIATED
WITH THE X2 X-RAY EVENT OF 30 OCTOBER WITH SOME CONTRIBUTION
FROM A WELL POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT 24 HOURS. GENERALLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS WITH ISOLATED MINOR
STORMING AT HIGH LATITUDES SHOULD CHARACTERIZE THE REMAINDER OF
THE PERIOD.
