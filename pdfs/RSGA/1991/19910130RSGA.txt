JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 030 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6466 (S09W38) PRO-
DUCED AN X1/2B FLARE AT 0904Z. THE EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MOD-
EST RADIO BURSTS WHICH TENDED TO BE STRONGER AT THE HIGHER FRE-
QUENCIES. THE GROUP ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/SN AT 1446Z. THE GROUP
CONTINUES TO DECAY, AND ITS DELTA CONFIGURATION APPEARED TO BE
BREAKING UP NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD. REGION 6471 (S12E15)
GREW DRAMATICALLY TODAY TO 2230 MILLIONTHS (UP FROM 1590 YES-
TERDAY), AND PRODUCED AN M1/SN AT 1432Z AS WELL AS NUMEROUS
SUBFLARES. THIS GROUP CONTINUES TO BE A COMPACT, DELTA CONFI-
GURATION WITH STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS AND GRADIENTS. REGION
6469 (S13W25) ALSO SHOWED REMARKABLE GROWTH TODAY AND IS
NOW A MATURE EKI GROUP AT 500 MILLIONTHS (UP FROM 230). THIS
REGION PRODUCED AN M1/SN AT 1758Z AS WELL AS NUMEROUS SUBFLARES.
REGION 6462 (S18W45) CONTINUES TO BE A LARGE GROUP AT 1140 BUT
IS SOMEWHAT SIMPLER MAGNETICALLY AND PRODUCED FREQUENT SUB-
FLARES. A 33 DEGREE FILAMENT NEAR S30W72 DISAPPEARED SOMETIME
BETWEEN 29/2055 AND 29/2220Z. TODAY'S SOLAR FLUX JUMPED UP AGAIN
TO 367. A MORE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT THIS IS THE
LARGEST FLUX LEVEL SINCE NOVEMBER 10, 1979 WHEN THE VALUE WAS
ALSO AT 367. (NOTE: THIS IS A CORRECTION TO THE STATEMENT MADE
YESTERDAY).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. REGION 6471 IS THE MAIN THREAT FOR A MAJOR FLARE, ALTHOUGH
A CONTRIBUTION FROM REGION 6466 OR 6462 IS ALSO POSSIBLE.
M-CLASS FLARES MAY ALSO COME FROM REGION 6469, GIVEN THE RECENT
REMARKABLE GROWTH IN THIS GROUP.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET FROM THE START OF THE PERIOD
UNTIL 1330Z. CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN QUIET TO UNSETTLED SINCE
THEN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. A
SMALL INCREASE TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS IS POSSIBLE ON
THE SECOND DAY IN RESPONSE TO TODAY'S X1 FLARE.
