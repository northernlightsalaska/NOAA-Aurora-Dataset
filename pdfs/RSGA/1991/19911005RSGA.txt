JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 278 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6850 (S12W57)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE: A LONG DURATION M1/SN THAT
BEGAN AT 1021Z, ATTAINED MAXIMUM AT 1048Z AND ENDED AT 1213Z.
THIS GROUP CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE DISK IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. THERE WAS SOME INDICATION OF MODEST PENUMBRAL
GROWTH AND COALESCENCE. OF INTEREST WAS THE FORMATION OF AN
ADDITIONAL DELTA CONFIGURATION WITH AN EAST-WEST INVERSION IN
THE REGION'S CENTER. REGION 6853 (S20W52) SHOWED SOME DECAY
TODAY AND COULD ONLY PRODUCE ONE C6/1F FLARE AT 0205Z. REGION
6861 (N08W07) SHOWED SLOW GROWTH AND PRODUCED A FEW SMALL
FLARES. THERE APPEARS TO BE A SMALL DELTA CONFIGURATION IN
THIS GROUP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THE NEW DELTA FORMED IN 6850 IS IN A REASON-
ABLE POSITION TO EXPECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHEARING. IF THIS
CAN REACH A POINT OF INSTABILITY THIS COULD TRIGGER A MAJOR
FLARE OUT OF THE GROUP. IN ADDITION REGION 6861 SHOWS A DELTA
CONFIGURATION WHICH IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN OCCASIONAL FLARES:
MOST OF THESE ARE EXPECTED TO BE SMALL TO POSSIBLY MODERATE
SIZED.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS INITIALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FROM
THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD UNTIL ABOUT 1200Z. SINCE THEN
CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY QUIET WITH SOME UNSETTLED PERIODS
AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO ACTIVE LEVELS WITH MINOR STORM PERIODS
AT HIGH LATITUDES SOMETIME TOMORROW, CONTINUING THROUGH THE
SECOND DAY AND GRADUALLY DECLINING BY DAY THREE. THE INCREASE
IS EXPECTED DUE TO EFFECTS FROM A CORONAL HOLE.
