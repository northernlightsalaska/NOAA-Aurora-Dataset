SDF NUMBER 282 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M1 X-RAY EVENT
MAXED AT 0552 UT, BUT NO OPTICAL FLARE WAS REPORTED.  C-CLASS
FLARES WERE OBSERVED IN REGION 6861 (N08W60), WHICH REMAINED
MOSTLY STABLE IN WHITE-LIGHT AND H-ALPHA.  THREE NEW REGIONS
WERE NUMBERED.  REGIONS 6874 (N01E67) AND 6875 (N15E68) ROTATED
OVER THE EAST LIMB, AND 6876 (S14W56) GREW RAPIDLY ON THE DISK.
AN 18 DEGREE-LONG FILAMENT APPEARED NEAR N05, CENTER DISK,
BETWEEN 1640 UT YESTERDAY AND 1445 UT TODAY.  SEVERAL ACTIVE
FILAMENTS PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF GENERAL RESTRUCTURING OF LARGE-
SCALE HELIOMAGNETIC FIELDS.  SURGING WAS REPORTED AT THE WEST
LIMB AS REGION 6850 (S12W94) DEPARTED THE VISIBLE DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THE ONLY REGIONS THAT PRESENTLY APPEAR CAPABLE OF EVEN
ISOLATED SIGNIFICANT FLARES ARE 6861 AND 6873 (S24E62).
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY HAS DECLINED FROM ACTIVE LEVELS AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE 24 HOUR PERIOD, TO QUIET LEVELS FOR THE
PAST 9 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO QUIET FOR THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS,
BECOMING GENERALLY QUIET BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
