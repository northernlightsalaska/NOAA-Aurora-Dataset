JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 151 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6654 (N04E13)
PRODUCED 2 M-CLASS FLARES TODAY: AN M3/2B AT 0245Z AND AN M1/2B
AT 0858Z. THE REGION IS SHOWING SLIGHT DECAY BUT CONTINUES TO
POSSESS A DELTA CONFIGURATION ALONG AN EXTENDED EAST-WEST
INVERSION LINE. REGION 6652 (S10E04) ALSO PRODUCED 2 M-CLASS
FLARES: THESE WERE AN M2/2N AT 0408Z AND AN M2/SF AT 1657Z.
THIS REGION SHOWS A COMPACT DELTA CONFIGURATION. REGION 6444
CONTINUES TO BE A LARGE (580 MILLIONTHS) GROUP BUT SHOWS A
SIMPLE MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION AND DID NOT PRODUCE ANY FLARES.
AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED RADIO EVENT OCCURRED AT ABOUT 0505Z
WHICH PRODUCED MODEST DISCRETE BURSTS, A TYPE II AND A TYPE IV
RADIO SWEEP. INTENSE CALCIUM EMISSION WAS OBSERVED TODAY ON EAST
LIMB AT ABOUT N40 PROBABLY THE FIRST INDICATION OF THE RETURN
OF OLD REGION 6619 (N30, L-266) WHICH PRODUCED 1 X-CLASS FLARE
AND 3 M-CLASS FLARES ON ITS PREVIOUS DISK TRANSIT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE, BUT WITH A FAIR CHANCE FOR HIGH LEVELS OF ACTIVITY AS
WELL. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR M-CLASS EVENTS ARE REGIONS
6644, 6652, AND 6654, WITH 6652 AND 6654 POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR
ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. A GRADUAL INCREASE IN BACKGROUND
LEVELS IS EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT DAYS WITH THE RETURN OF OLD
REGION 6619.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THE PERIOD UNTIL ABOUT 0300Z. SINCE THEN CONDITIONS HAVE
BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WITH SOME ISOLATED MAJ-
OR STORMING AT HIGH LATITUDES. A SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED
AT 1039Z. THIS EVENT WAS FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL INCREASE IN
GREATER THAN 10 MEV PARTICLES WHICH CROSSED EVENT THRESHOLD
AT 1225Z, ATTAINED A MAXIMUM OF 20 PFU AT 1515UT AND CONTINUES
IN PROGRESS JUST ABOVE EVENT LEVEL. A FORBUSH DECREASE ALSO
GRADUALLY SET IN DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD TO A MAXIMUM
DEPRESSION OF ABOUT 5 PERCENT. THE MULTIPLICITY OF FLARES
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS MAKES THE CAUSE UNCERTAIN, ALTHOUGH
THE LONG DURATION M2 FLARE OF 29 MAY IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO
MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS THEREAFTER.
