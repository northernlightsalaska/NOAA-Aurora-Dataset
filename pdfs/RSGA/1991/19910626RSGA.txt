JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 177 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6695 (N03E47) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S LARGEST X-RAY EVENT: A C6/SF AT 0154Z. RAPID
GROWTH WAS OBSERVED IN REGION 6694 (N05E22), WHICH IS NOW
THE LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK AT 400 MILLIONTHS. REGION 6697
(S05E12) SHOWED MODEST GROWTH. SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON EAST
LIMB AT N11 AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERATED CALCIUM XV
EMISSION. A C2 FLARE WHICH OCCURRED AT 2014Z WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY AN UNUSUALLY OUTSTANDING SET OF DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS (IN-
CLUDING A TENFLARE) A MODERATE TYPE II AND A MODERATE TYPE IV.
ALTHOUGH THE CORRESPONDING OPTICAL PHENOMENA COULD NOT BE UN-
AMBIGOUSLY IDENTIFIED, AN EPL WAS NOTED ON THE WEST LIMB AT S13
OUT TO .11 RADII IT APPEARS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR
THE EVENT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR FLARES ARE REGIONS 6694, 6695,
AND 6697.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOME
PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH
LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS.
