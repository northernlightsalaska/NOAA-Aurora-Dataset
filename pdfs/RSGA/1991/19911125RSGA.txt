THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS. THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS DURING THE NEXT 7 DAYS
IN RESPONSE TO HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND STREAMS FROM A SEQUENCE
OF NEGATIVE POLARITY CORONAL HOLES PRESENTLY VISIBLE IN
HELIUM 1083 NM IMAGES.
