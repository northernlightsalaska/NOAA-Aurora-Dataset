JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 237 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 25 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. NEW REGION 6810 (N25E64)
PRODUCED AN X2/2B FLARE AT 25/0115Z. A 2100 SFU TENFLARE, STRONG
TYPE IV SWEEP, AND LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM WERE ASSOCIATED WITH
THE FLARE. THIS REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/SF FLARE AT 25/0939Z.
REGION 6807 (S07E56) PRODUCED AN M1/2N FLARE AT 25/1830Z. REGION
6781 (S17W86) SHOWED SIGNS OF SLIGHT DECAY, WHILE REMAINING
LARGE AND MODERATELY COMPLEX, AS IT APPROACHED THE WEST LIMB.
NEW REGION 6809 (S16E53) WAS ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6810 IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ISOLATED
MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 6781 MAY PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY
WHILE CROSSING THE LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. AN ISOLATED PERIOD OF ACTIVE LEVELS
OCCURRED NEAR 25/0300Z. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUX
BECAME SLIGHTLY ENHANCED NEAR 25/1600Z IN RESPONSE TO THE
X2/2B FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS.
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE
FINAL DAY IN RESPONSE TO THE X2/2B FLARE. THE 27 DAY RECURRENT
PATTERN ALSO SUPPORTS AN INCREASE ON THE THIRD DAY. THE
GREATER THAN 10 MEV FLUX ENHANCEMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO REACH
EVENT LEVEL.
