JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 302 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6891 (S11W19)
PRODUCED TODAY'S LARGEST FLARE: AN M4/2N WHICH BEGAN AT 1809Z
AND ENDED AT 1938Z WITH A MAXIMUM AT 1912Z. THE EVENT WAS AC-
COMPANIED BY WEAK DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. THIS REGION PRODUCED
ADDITIONAL OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES DURING THE DAY. ALTHOUGH
THE REGION CONTINUES TO BE LARGE AND IMPRESSIVE MAGNETICALLY
THERE WAS SOME INDICATION OF DECAY AND FRAGMENTATION IN THE
GROUP. ONE OTHER M-CLASS EVENT WAS OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD,
AN UNCORRELATED M1 AT 1000Z. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED
TODAY: 6900 (S10E53) AND 6901 (S14E01), BOTH OF WHICH PRO-
DUCED OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6891 IS THE MAIN THREAT FOR CONTINUED
MODERATE TO MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. M-FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM
REGIONS 6892 AND PERHAPS 6893.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM ACTIVE TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS. A SEVERE STORM WAS OBSERVED FROM 29/0000Z THROUGH
1200UT AT ALL LATITUDES. K-INDICES OF 7 AND 8 WERE TYPICAL
DURING THE DISTURBANCE. SINCE 1200UT CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN
AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS. THE SOURCE OF THE DIS-
TURBANCE IS UNCERTAIN: THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES APPEAR TO
BE EITHER THE LONG DURATION M1 FLARE OR THE X1 FLARE,
BOTH OF WHICH OCCURRED ON THE 26TH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 24
HOURS, WITH A POSSIBLITY FOR OCCASIONAL SEVERE CONDITIONS AT
HIGH LATITUDES, PARTICULARLY IF INCREASED EFFECTS RESULT FROM
AN X6 MAJOR FLARE WHICH OCCURRED ON THE 27TH. A GRADUAL
DECLINE TOWARD MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS IS EXPECTED ON
THE SECOND DAY, AND ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE
EXPECTED BY DAY THREE.
