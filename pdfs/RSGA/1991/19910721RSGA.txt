JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 202 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6737 (S15E49) PRO-
DUCED THE LARGEST OF TODAY'S MINIMAL FLARE ACTIVITY: A C4/SF AT
0037Z. THIS GROUP SHOWED MAGNETIC SIMPLIFICATION AND BECAME
LESS ACTIVE DURING THE DAY. REGION 6734 (N08E48) CONTINUES TO
DOMINATE THE DISK IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY WITH A CONTINUED DELTA
CONFIGURATION AND CONTINUED GROWTH. NEVERTHELESS THE REGION ONLY
PRODUCED A COUPLE SUBFLARES. A NEW MATURE GROUP ROTATED INTO
VIEW TODAY AS 6741 (N10E67) BUT WAS FLARE QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE WITH A FAIR CHANCE FOR ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE
ACTIVITY. REGION 6734 IN PARTICULAR SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR
FLARES DUE TO ITS STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS AND GRADIENTS. REGIONS
6737 AND 6741 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO M-CLASS LEVEL ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. A PERIOD
OF ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WITH SOME HIGH LATITUDE MAJOR
STORMING OCCURRED FROM 0000-0730Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE WITH OCCASIONAL MINOR STORM PERIODS TO-
MORROW, DECLINING TO MOSTLY ACTIVE ON THE SECOND DAY, AND TO
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS BY THE THIRD DAY. THE FORECAST IS
BASED ON A COMBINATION OF PERSISTENCE AND POSSIBLE EFFECTS
FROM THE X-CLASS FLARE OF 20 JULY, WITH THE MAXIMUM EFFECT
TOMORROW AND A GRADUAL DECLINE OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD AS
THE DISTURBANCE SUBSIDES.
