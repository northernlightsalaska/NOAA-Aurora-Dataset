JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 048 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 FEB 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M1 X RAY EVENT
WITH TYPE II, ASSOCIATED WITH SURGING ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB,
OCCURRED AT 0622Z. THIS WAS THE SOLE M-CLASS EVENT OF THE PERIOD
AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY NEW REGION 6509 (S19E81).
THIS IS THE LIKELY RETURN OF OLD REGION 6462 THAT GENERATED
M-CLASS ACTIVITY LAST ROTATION. FOUR OTHER NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED: 6505 (S13E28), 6506 (N29E48), 6507 (S03E58), AND
6508 (S12E81). ELSEWHERE, SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON BOTH EAST
AND WEST LIMBS AS ACTIVE COMPLEXES ARE COMING AND GOING.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. NEW REGION 6509 SEEMS TO POSSESS THE ABILITY TO
PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGION 6504
(S16E51) DOES AS WELL. THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEW REGIONS AT
EAST LIMB MAY MARK THE BEGINNING OF A PERIOD OF HEIGHTENED
ACTIVITY SIMILAR TO THIS POINT LAST ROTATION. X RAY BACK-
GROUND LEVELS ARE ELEVATED AND THE 10.7 CM. FLUX IS STEADILY
INCREASING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
