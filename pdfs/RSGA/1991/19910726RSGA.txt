JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 207 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  REGIONS 6734 (N08W16)
AND 6741 (N10E01) CONTINUE TO PRODUCE C-CLASS X-RAY ACTIVITY.
THESE REGIONS ARE LITTLE CHANGED FROM YESTERDAY.  BOTH CONTAIN
SMALL DELTA CONFIGURATIONS BUT DO NOT HAVE EXCESSIVE MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY.  POST FLARE LOOPS WERE OBSERVED NEAR THE EQUATOR
ON THE EAST LIMB AT ABOUT 26/1515Z.  A SMALL INCREASE IN X-RAYS
WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOOPS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO CLEARLY CLASSIFY
AS A X-RAY FLARE.  SPOTS OR PLAGE ARE NOT YET VISIBLE AT THE
LIMB.  NEW REGION 6750 (N12E64) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGIONS 6734 AND 6741 ARE THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCES OF ACTIVITY.  THE POSSIBILITY OF EAST LIMB FLARES WILL
INCREASE AS THE SOURCE OF THE LOOPS MENTIONED IN PART IA
DRAWS CLOSER TO THE VISIBLE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
