JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 338 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6952 (N18E55)
PRODUCED AN M4/SF FLARE AT 04/1757Z AND AN M1/1N AT 04/1138Z.
MINOR RADIO EMISSIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FLARES.
THE REGION DISPLAYED MODERATE GROWTH IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY WITH SEVERAL OBSERVATORIES REPORTING A MAGNETIC DELTA
CONFIGURATION IN THE TRAILER PORTION OF THE REGION. AN ERUPTIVE
PROMINENCE REACHING AT LEAST 0.30 SOLAR RADII WAS OBSERVED AT
04/1928Z NEAR N18E90. ACTIVE SURGING OCCURRED NEAR S09E90 MIDWAY
THROUGH THE PERIOD, PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETURN OF OLD
ACTIVE REGION 6919 WHICH IS DUE BACK EARLY ON 05 DECEMBER. NEW
REGION 6957 (S14W59) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6952 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES. IT IS ALSO CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED.
