JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 093 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6562 (N15W10)
PRODUCED AN M6/3B FLARE WITH SIGNIFICANT TYPE IV SWEEP AT
02/2327Z. THE OPTICAL FLARE EXHIBITED PARALLEL RIBBONS AND AN
IMPRESSIVE LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM. THE VERY LONG DURATION OF THE
EVENT SUGGESTS A SIGNIFICANT CORONAL MASS EJECTION MAY HAVE
OCCURRED. THIS REGION IS CURRENTLY THE MOST MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX
SPOT AREA ON THE DISK BUT HAS SHOWN NO SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE
PAST 48 HOURS. REGION 6565 (N10E18) HAS INCREASED SOMEWHAT IN
COMPLEXITY WITH A FEW ISOLATED SUBFLARES TO ITS CREDIT TODAY.
NEW REGIONS 6567 (S13E52) AND 6568 (S08E60) WERE ASSIGNED.
BOTH CURRENTLY CONSIST OF SIMPLE BIPOLAR SPOT GROUPS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6562 OR 6565 MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES WITH PERIODS OF MAJOR STORMING
EVIDENT AT HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS. A WELL POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE APPEARS TO BE THE SOURCE FOR THE ACTIVITY AT
PRESENT. A SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN
10 MEV BEGAN AT 03/0815Z, REACHED A TENTATIVE PEAK OF
25 PFU AT 03/0910Z, AND CONTINUED IN PROGRESS THROUGH THE
END OF THE PERIOD. THE PROTON FLUX HAD ALREADY BEEN ENHANCED
PRIOR TO THIS EVENT WITH THE MAJOR EVENT NOTED IN SECTION 1A.
ABOVE RESPONSIBLE FOR ELEVATING IT TO EVENT LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE AT THE START OF THE PERIOD IN
RESPONSE TO EFFECTS FROM A CORONAL HOLE. STORM CONDITIONS ARE
POSSIBLE BY THE 5TH IN RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR FLARE NOTED ABOVE.
THE SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON EVENT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
