THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET AT MIDDLE LAT-
ITUDES. HIGH LATITUDES WERE MORE DISTURBED. YESTERDAY'S
GEOMAGNETIC STORM WEAKENED EARLY TODAY AND IS STILL OF
DUBIOUS ORIGIN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE HIGH LAT-
