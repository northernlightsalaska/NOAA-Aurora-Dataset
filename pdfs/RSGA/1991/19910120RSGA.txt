JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 020 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S ACTIVITY CONSISTED
OF A FEW C-CLASS SUBFLARES FROM A VARIETY OF REGIONS. THE
LARGEST EVENT OBSERVED IN X-RAYS WAS A C8 AT 0724Z WHICH WAS
NOT OBSERVED OPTICALLY. REGION 6444 (N16W86) IS ROTATING OFF
QUIETLY WITH SURGE ACTIVITY NOW VISIBLE ON THE WEST LIMB.
REGION 6455 (S14W48) SHOWS CONTINUED GROWTH, POSSESSES MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY, AND PRODUCED A C6/SF AT 0929Z. REGION 6458 (N23E12)
SHOWED GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD IN A SIMPLE CONFIGURATION AND
PRODUCED TWO C-CLASS FLARES. SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON THE EAST
LIMB AT N10, S10, AND S24.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY LOW, BUT WITH A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE FROM EITHER 6455 OR 6444. ACTIVITY LEVELS SHOULD DECLINE
AS 6444 ROTATES FROM VIEW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. AN
INCREASE IS POSSIBLE TOMORROW DUE TO EFFECTS OF A RECURRENT
CORONAL HOLE. SOME DISTURBANCE EFFECTS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE ON
THE THIRD DAY IN RESPONSE TO THE FILAMENT NEAR S24E09 THAT
DISAPPEARED YESTERDAY.
