TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. SEVEN M-CLASS X-RAY
BURSTS OCCURRED, NONE OF WHICH REACHED THE MAJOR CATEGORY.
REGION 6471 (S12W78) REMAINED THE MOST ACTIVE REGION PRODUCING
FOUR M-CLASS FLARES INCLUDING THE LARGEST OF THE PERIOD: AN
M4/1N AT 06/1506Z. THE OTHERS WERE AN M1/1N AT 06/0426Z, AN
M3/SF AT 06/1840Z, AND AN M1/SF AT 06/2022Z. SLIGHT DECAY WAS
NOTED WITHIN THE REGION, BUT IT REMAINED MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX.
REGION 6487 (N15E55) DISPLAYED GROWTH, BOTH IN SIZE AND
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. IT PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES INCLUDING AN
M1/SF AT 06/0835Z. TWO OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M-CLASS X-RAY
BURSTS OCCURRED: AN M1 AT 06/0650Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
290 SFU TENFLARE, AND AN M1 AT 06/1543Z. NO NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6471 AND 6487 MAY PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES WITH
6471 POSING A SLIGHT THREAT FOR X-CLASS ACTIVITY.
