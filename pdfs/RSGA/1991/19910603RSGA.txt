JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 154 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6648 (S13W53)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS EVENT: AN M1/SF AT 03/2102Z. THE
REGION CONTINUES TO GROW BUT LESS SLOWLY THAN THE LAST TWO DAYS.
REGION 6659 (N30E65) ROTATED MORE FULLY INTO VIEW TODAY AS AN
APPARENT DKC DELTA GROUP WITH 770 MILLIONTHS IN AREA. THE REGION
WAS SUPRISINGLY UNPRODUCTIVE TODAY, GENERATING ONLY ONE FLARE:
A C9/1F AT 0208Z. REGIONS 6654 (N07W29) AND 6652 (S09W36) WERE
BOTH ESSENTIALLY FLARE QUIET AND SHOWED STEADY DECAY. REGION
6644 (N22W84) WAS ALSO QUIET AND PRODUCED SURGE ACTIVITY AS IT
BEGAN TO TRANSIT THE WEST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR M-FLARES ARE REGIONS 6659
AND 6652, WITH POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM 6648 AND 6654 AS
WELL. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A FAIR CHANCE FOR MAJOR FLARE
ACTIVITY FROM REGION 6659.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
TODAY. THE FIELD WAS INITIALLY AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
FROM 02/2100Z-2400Z. CONDITIONS QUIETED THEREAFTER TO MOSTLY
QUIET TO UNSETTLED UNTIL A SUBSTORM PERIOD OF ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM CONDITIONS OCCURRED FROM 0600-0900Z. SINCE THEN AC-
TIVITY LEVELS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH OC-
CASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTON EVENT ENDED TODAY AT 1235Z. THE MAXIMUM FLUX
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS WAS 21 PFU AT 02/2135Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS,
PRIMARILY BASED ON PERSISTENCE. SOME CONTRIBUTION TO ACTIVITY
IS POSSIBLE ON THE 2ND DAY AS A RESPONSE TO YESTERDAY'S LONG
DURATION M2 FLARE FROM REGION 6652.
