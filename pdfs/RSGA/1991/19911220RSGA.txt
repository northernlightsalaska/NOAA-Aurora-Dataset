JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 354 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6982 (S14E55) PRO-
DUCED AN X3/2B FLARE AT 1411UT. THE EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
STRONG RADIO BURSTS, A STRONG TYPE II AND A WEAK TYPE IV RADIO
EVENT. THE REGION SHOWED INCREASED AREA TODAY (680 MILLIONTHS)
AND APPEARS TO POSSESS A DELTA CONFIGURATION, ALTHOUGH ITS
PROXIMITY TO THE LIMB LIMITED MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. THIS
GROUP WAS NOT OBSERVED TO PRODUCE ANY OTHER FLARES DURING THE
PERIOD. REGION 6972 (S10E09) PRODUCED THE ONLY OTHER FLARE
WORTHY OF NOTE: A C7/SN AT 1101Z. THE REMAINDER OF THE REGIONS
DID NOT FLARE. NEW REGION 6983 (S09W14) EMERGED TODAY AS A
SMALL D-TYPE GROUP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6972 AND 6982 ARE THE ONLY GROUPS THAT APPEAR
TO BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING M-CLASS LEVEL ACTIVITY. THERE IS A
SLIGHT TO FAIR CHANCE FOR ANOTHER ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE FROM
REGION 6982.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
A BRIEF ACTIVE PEROD WAS OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM
1500-1800UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS. THE INCREASE FOR
THE FIRST DAY IS EXPECTED FROM CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS AND FOR
THE SECOND DAY FROM TODAY'S MAJOR FLARE. CONDITIONS SHOULD
SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED BY THE THIRD DAY.
