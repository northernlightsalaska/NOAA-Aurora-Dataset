TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6583 (N10E73)
PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS EVENTS, AN M1/1N AT 0344Z AND AN M1/0F
AT 2030Z. BOTH OF THESE FLARES HAD A DOUBLE MAXIMUM IN SOFT
X-RAYS. THE REGION HAD A PART IN THE OTHER M-CLASS EVENT, AN

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6583 SEEMS TO HAVE THE BEST POTENTIAL FOR
ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES OF THE 15 DISK REGIONS. HOWEVER,
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO OTHERS, 6566 (S21W35) AND 6580, THAT
COULD SUMMON AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
