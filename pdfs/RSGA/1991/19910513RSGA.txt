JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 133 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  AN M8 FLARE OCCURRED
13/0144UT.  THIS EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SMALL RADIO BURSTS
AND TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS.  LOOPS WERE OBSERVED OVER THE SOUTH
WEST LIMB SEVERAL HOURS LATER.  THE SOURCE OF THIS EVENT IS
THOUGHT TO BE REGION 6615 (S09 W110) WHICH CROSSED WEST LIMB
ON 12 MAY.  IN ADDITION TO THE M8, SEVERAL SMALLER M CLASS
FLARES WERE NOTED, HOWEVER, MOST WERE OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED.
REGION 6619 (N30W28) REMAINS THE LARGEST SPOT GROUP ON THE DISK
BUT HAS BEEN QUIET.  GROWTH IN REGION 6624 (S17E04) APPEARS TO
HAVE SLOWED.  REGION 6632 (SO8E10) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  NO MAJOR ACTIVE REGIONS ARE DUE TO RETURN IN
THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THE FIELD WAS QUIET UNTIL 0900UT WHEN
A SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED (52 GAMMAS AT BOULDER).  THE
FIELD HAS BEEN AT STORM LEVELS FOLLOWING THE SI.  THE SOURCE
OF THIS ACTIVITY IS PROBABLY THE LONG DURATION M2 FLARE FROM
REGION 6619 LATE ON 11 MAY.  A PROTON EVENT, MOST LIKELY FROM
THE M8 FLARE MENTIONED IN PART IA, BEGAN AT 0300UT AND REACHED
A PEAK OF 350PFU AT 0910UT.  A PCA IS ACCOMPANYING THIS EVENT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.  THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE
IN ACTIVITY LATE IN THE PERIOD FROM A CORONAL HOLE NOW LOCATED
AT CENTRAL MERIDIAN.
