JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 182 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 6703 (N30E65)
PRODUCED AN M5/1N LONG-DURATION FLARE AT 01/0240Z.  THIS REGION
ALSO PRODUCED SEVERAL OTHER SMALLER FLARES INCLUDING AN M1/SF
AT 01/1952Z.  THE SUNSPOTS IN THIS REGION ARE NOW MOSTLY IN
VIEW.  OVERALL, THE GROUP APPEARS SMALLER AND MORE FRAGMENTED
THAN DURING ITS LAST DISK TRANSIT (OLD 6659).  HOWEVER,
ADDITIONAL SPOTS ARE NEAR THE EAST LIMB A FEW DEGREES TO THE
NORTH OF 6703 AND MAY ALSO BE REMNANTS OF OLD 6659.  THE OTHER
DISK REGIONS WERE FAIRLY QUIET.  NEW REGIONS NUMBERED INCLUDE
6710 (S32W16), 6711 (N21E65), AND 6712 (S15E61).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  REGION 6703 IS EXPECTED TO BE THE PRIMARY
FLARE PRODUCER.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDE
STATIONS AND ACTIVE TO UNSETTLED AT HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS.
A SATELLITE PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV CONTINUES IN
PROGRESS (BEGIN 30/0755Z).  SO FAR THE PEAK FLUX AT GREATER
THAN 10 MEV WAS 88 PFU AT 01/2100Z.  A MINOR PCA BEGAN AT
01/1750Z IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE PROTON EVENT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES.  THE PROTON EVENT IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN PROGRESS FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS OR SO.
