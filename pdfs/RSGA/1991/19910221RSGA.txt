JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 052 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 FEB 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S LARGEST EVENT WAS
A C4/1N AT 2329Z FROM REGION 6508 (S13E37). THE GROUP CONTINUES
TO HAVE LARGE SPOTS BUT THEIR MAGNETIC POLARITIES ALL APPEAR TO
BE THE SAME, FORMING AN APPARENT UNIPOLAR REGION. REGION 6509
(S20E33) IS STILL THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK AND SHOWED SOME
GROWTH BUT COULD ONLY PRODUCE A COUPLE OF C-CLASS FLARES. THIS
REGION SHOWS STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS BUT WEAK GRADIENTS AND
LITTLE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP SIGNIFICANT SHEAR. TWO NEW REGIONS
WERE ASSIGNED TODAY: 6516 AT S11E77 AND 6517 AT S13E23. THERE
CONTINUED TO BE SURGING ON THE EAST LIMB AROUND S10, SUGGESTING
THAT ANOTHER REGION OR MORE PLAGE WILL BE ROTATING INTO VIEW
OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THIS AREA CORRESPONDS WELL TO THE
LOCATION OF OLD REGION 6471.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE MAIN THREATS FOR FLARE ACTIVITY ARE REGIONS 6509,
6508, 6504 AND 6497 (S13W36). REGION 6497 MAY START PRODUCING
FLARES DUE TO THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF A DELTA CONFIGURATION
IN THE GROUP.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
