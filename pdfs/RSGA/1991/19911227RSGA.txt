JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 361 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. FIVE M-CLASS EVENTS WERE
OBSERVED. THE FIRST WAS AN M4/1B AT 26/2145Z FROM REGION 6985
(S18E09) WHICH HAD AN ASSOCIATED 300 SFU TENFLARE. THIS REGION
EXHIBITED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SIZE AND STRUCTURE, REMAIN-
ING MODERATELY COMPLEX IN MAGNETIC ASPECTS. REGION 6982 (S12W35)
PRODUCED AN M1/1N FLARE AT 27/0311Z AND AN M2/SN (WITH AN
ASSOCIATED 310 SFU TENFLARE) AT 27/1731Z. THIS REGION DISPLAYED
SOME PENUMBRAL DECAY IN ITS LEADER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHOWED
GROWTH IN ITS TRAILER. ALL TOLD, THE REGION RETAINED ITS
STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY WITH A MAGNETIC DELTA CONFIGURATION
APPARENT IN ITS CENTRAL PORTION. THE REMAINING TWO M-CLASS X-RAY
BURSTS WERE NOT OPTICALLY CORRELATED: AN M2 AT 27/0618Z AND AN
M1 AT 27/1113Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 430 SFU TENFLARE AND
A MAJOR TYPE IV SWEEP. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6982 AND 6985 ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
M-CLASS ACTIVITY. REGION 6985 MAY ALSO PRODUCE A MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE HIGH
LATITUDE FIELD VARIED FROM UNSETTLED TO STORM LEVELS. THE
STORMING WAS OBSERVED FROM 27/1200-1500Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED.
