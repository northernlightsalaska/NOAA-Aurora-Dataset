FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM

LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE SEVERE STORM PERIOD OCCURRED
BETWEEN 03/1200-1500Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE
FIRST TWO DAYS DUE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS. THE FIELD IS
