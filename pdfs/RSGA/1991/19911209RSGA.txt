JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 343 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. FREQUENT M-CLASS FLARING
CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. REGION 6961 (N10E39) GENERATED
THE MAJORITY OF THESE FLARES TO INCLUDE THE TWO LARGEST: AN
M5/SF EVENT AT 08/2316Z AND AN M7/SN EVENT AT 1354Z. BOTH FLARES
DISPLAYED ONLY WEAK RADIO EMISSIONS AND WERE OF SHORT DURATION.
THIS REGION CONTINUES TO GROW IN SPOT AREA AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. REGION 6952 (N18W11) PRODUCED ISOLATED SUBFLARES
WHILE DECAYING IN SIZE. REGIONS 6963 (S11W18) AND 6958 (S18E05)
CONTRIBUTED OCCASIONAL FLARING WHILE DISPLAYING SIGNIFICANT
GROWTH. SEVERAL UNCORRELATED M-CLASS X-RAY EVENTS WERE NOTED
DURING THE PERIOD AND MAY HAVE ORIGINATED FROM NEW REGION 6966
(S03E76) WHICH HAS JUST ROTATED INTO VIEW. NEW REGION 6967
(S27E13) WAS ALSO ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. FREQUENT M-CLASS FLARING IS LIKELY FROM REGION 6961 WITH
REGIONS 6963, 6958, AND 6952 CONTRIBUTING OCCASIONAL FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED DUE TO EFFECTS FROM A WELL
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
