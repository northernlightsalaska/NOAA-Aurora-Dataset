JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 082 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 6555 (S24E06)
PRODUCED A NUMBER OF MAJOR FLARES SINCE YESTERDAY.  THE TWO
MOST SIGNIFICANT WERE A X9/3B AT 22/2247Z AND AN M6/2B AT
23/0429Z.  THE X9 FLARE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 36000 SFU
RADIO BURST AT 2695 MHZ AND A STRONG TYPE II SWEEP.  THE M6
FLARE WAS LONG DURATION, OVER THREE HOURS FROM START TO HALF
POWER, AND WAS MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH A CORONAL MASS
EJECTION.  THIS REGION REMAINS QUITE LARGE (OVER 2000 MILLIONTHS
OF THE SOLAR HEMISPHERE) AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX.  REGION 6558
(S14E52) PRODUCED A FEW SMALL FLARES OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.
NEW REGION 6559 (N13E16) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH.  MAJOR FLARES ARE POSSIBLE IN REGION 6555.  ISOLATED
M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN REGION 6558.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.  A PROTON EVENT
AT SATELLITE ALTITUDES BEGAN AT 23/0820Z.  THE FLUX AT 23/2100Z
WAS 5300 PFU AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV, 17 PFU AT GREATER THAN
100 MEV, AND CONTINUES TO INCREASE.  A POLAR CAP ABSORPTION
EVENT BEGAN AT ABOUT 23/0931Z AND WAS 24.5 DB AT 23/2100Z.
THIS ACTIVITY IS PRESUMED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER THE X9
OR M6 FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT STORM LEVELS IN RESPONSE TO THE FLARE
ACTIVITY OUTLINED ABOVE.  MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED FOR ABOUT 48 HOURS FOLLOWING THE ARRIVAL OF A
SSC SOMETIME TOMORROW.  THE PROTON AND PCA EVENTS ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE.
