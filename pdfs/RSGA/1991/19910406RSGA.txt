JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 096 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. A C7/1N FLARE FROM
REGION 6562 (N15W50) WAS THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE DAY.
ALTHOUGH FEW FLARES OCCURRED, FOUR NEW ACTIVE REGIONS WERE
BORN ON THE DISK. THEY ARE REGIONS 6575 (S10W04), 6576
(N23E18), 6577 (N09E30), AND 6578 (S19E61). THE LATTER
TWO HAVE ALREADY GENERATED SUBFLARES, AND 6578 IS REPORTED
TO BE BRIGHT IN H-ALPHA. THE NEWLY ASSIGNED REGIONS BRING
THE TOTAL OF SUNSPOT GROUPS NOW VISIBLE TO 16, BUT THE
GREAT MAJORITY ARE STABLE AND BENIGN. THE LIMBS WERE QUIET
THE LAST 24 HOURS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6562 OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE OF AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT. THE ANTICIPATED RETURN OF OLD REGION
6545 TO EAST LIMB HAS YET TO BE SEEN.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
