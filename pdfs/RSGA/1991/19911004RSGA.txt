JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 277 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH BY VITRUE OF AN M5/SB FROM
REGION 6861 (N09E06) AT 1929UT. THIS REGION HAS SHOWN SOME
GROWTH THE PAST 24 HOURS BUT NOTHING SPECTACTULAR. THE FLARE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY MINOR RADIO BURSTS BUT THERE WERE NO TYPE II OR
IV RADIO SWEEPS REPORTED. EARLIER IN THE DAY REGION 6853
(S21W37) PRODUCED AN M1/SN AT 0944UT. THIS FLARE WAS ALMOST
SIMULTANEOUS WITH ONE OBSERVED IN REGION 5850 (S11W40). THESE
TWO REGIONS HAVE BEGUN A SLIGHT DECAY WHICH MAY MAKE THEM MORE
UNSTABLE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. REGION 6655 (N17W18)
CONTINUED ITS SLOW GROWTH TODAY BUT WAS MOSTLY QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE. REGIONS 6850 AND 6853 POSE THE GREATEST THREAT
OF MODERATE ACTIVITY AND AS THE BEGIN TO DECAY THEIR
INSTABILITY MAY RESULT IN AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE. ANOTHER
MAJOR FLARE FROM REGION 6861 IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS SEEMS
UNLIKELY ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL MODERATE FLARING IS POSSIBLE.

REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BEGIN THE PERIOD AT MOSTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS.
