JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 245 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 SEP 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6805 (N24W40),
WHILE CONTINUING TO DECLINE IN AREA AND COMPLEXITY, EXHIBITED
AN INCREASE IN FLARE PRODUCTION DURING THE PERIOD WITH SEVERAL
LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS EVENTS NOTED. REGION 6811 (S15E01) PRODUCED
ISOLATED C-CLASS SUBFLARING AS WELL. SOME INCREASE IN GROWTH
WAS NOTED IN REGION 6812 (N11W31) WHICH CONTRIBUTED SOME
SUBFLARING. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED ON THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB AT 02/0926Z. A TYPE II SWEEP WITH AN ESTIMATED
SHOCK SPEED OF 1000 KM/SEC WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY.
NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE COMPLEX OF ABUTTED REGIONS, 6810 (S20W15),
6811, AND 6814 (S22E07) APPEAR TO POSE A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS. ISOLATED SEVERE STORMING WAS NOTED AT HIGH
LATITUDES AS EFFECTS FROM A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL
HOLE CONTINUED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT 12-24 HOURS. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD
PREVAIL THEREAFTER.
