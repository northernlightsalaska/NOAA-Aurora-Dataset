JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 076 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6545 (S08W14) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY MAJOR FLARE, AN IMPULSIVE M6/2B AT 2158Z
WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG RADIO BURSTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM
THE GROUP ALSO PRODUCED AN M2/SB AT 1754Z. THIS REGION SHOWED
SLIGHT DECAY AND POSSIBLE MAGNETIC SIMPLIFICATION, ALTHOUGH
THERE WAS STILL SOME EVIDENCE OF A SMALL DELTA IN THE BOTTOM
PART OF THE LEADER SPOT. A HOT NEW REGION 6555 (S23E77) ROTATED
INTO VIEW TODAY AND PRODUCED FOUR M-CLASS EVENTS: AN M1/1B AT
0219Z, M1/SN AT 0507Z, M2/2B AT 0933Z, AND M2/2B AT 1441Z. THE
REGION DISPLAYED SURGING ON THE LIMB, INCLUDING A BRIGHT SURGE
OUT TO .15 RADII FROM 1855-2016Z. THE OTHER PRIMARY REGION ON
THE DISK, 6538 (S23W66) SHOWED ABOUT 40% DECAY IN SIZE BUT STILL
PRODUCED TWO ENERGETIC FLARES AS FOLLOWS: AN M1/SN AT 0147Z AND
AN M1/SN AT 0543Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. ADDITIONAL M-FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM REGIONS
6538, 6545 AND 6555. ISOLATED MAJOR FLARES ARE ALSO LIKELY FROM
REGION 6545 OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS AS IT CONTINUES TO HAVE
STRONG MAGNETIC GRADIENTS IN A HIGHLY CONTORTED CONFIGURATION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A SUDDEN
IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED AT ABOUT 17/2035Z. IT MEASURED 12 NT IN
BOULDER. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTONS REMAINED ENHANCED
SLIGHTLY ABOVE BACKGROUND THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATI-
TUDES AND AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
THE INCREASE IS EXPECTED AS A RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR FLARE OF
16 MARCH. CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE SOME TO
ACTIVITY ON THE THIRD DAY.
