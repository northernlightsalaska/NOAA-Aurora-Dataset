IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS SINCE A 54 NANOTESLA SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS RECORDED AT
BOULDER AT 1054Z. PRESUMABLY THE SHOCK ORIGINATED IN EARLIER
ENERGETIC FLARE ACTIVITY FROM REGION 6891, PERHAPS THE LONG-
DURATION M1 WITH LENGTHY TYPE IV SWEEP EARLY ON 26 OCTOBER.
AT APPROXIMATELY 1537Z THE FIELD EXPERIENCED ANOTHER JOLT,
THIS A CHANGE OF ABOUT 400 NANOTESLA AT MID-LATITUDES IN
JUST A FEW MINUTES. A STRONG FORBUSH DECREASE MEASURING ABOUT
10 PERCENT BEGAN ABOUT 0900Z. A SMALL PROTON EVENT AT GREATER
THAN 10 MEV CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AT 1300Z, ATTAINED A 40 PFU
MAXIMUM AT 1440Z, AND IS DECAYING TO BACKGROUND LEVELS AT
THIS WRITING. THESE SLOW TO ARRIVE PARTICLES ARE THOUGHT TO
BE FROM THE X-CLASS FLARES OF 27 OCT. A SMALL POLAR CAP
ABSORPTION OF 2.2 DB OCCURRED AT 1530Z AND ALSO HAS ABATED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS THE DURATION OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD. ADDITIONAL FLARE-INDUCED SHOCKS FROM THE
MAJOR FLARES OF 27 OCT MAY PASS AND FUEL THE CURRENT STORM.
