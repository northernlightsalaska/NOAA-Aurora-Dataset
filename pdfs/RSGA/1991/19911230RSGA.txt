JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 364 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6982 (S15W74)
CONTINUED TO SLOWLY DECAY, BUT WAS ABLE TO MUSTER AN M4/SF FLARE
AT 30/1018Z ASSOCIATED WITH A 500 SFU TENFLARE AND A SIGNIFICANT
TYPE IV SWEEP. REGION 6985 (S17W29) ALSO DISPLAYED MINOR DECAY
AND PRODUCED AN M2/2F FLARE AT 30/1239Z WITH MINOR RADIO BURSTS.
REGION 6988 (S15W09) DISPLAYED AN INCREASE IN MAGNETIC FIELD
GRADIENT AND SPOT NUMBER AND PRODUCED AN M2/2N FLARE AT 30/1937Z
WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MINOR RADIO EMISSIONS. AN M3 X-RAY
BURST OCCURRED AT 30/1654Z. BRIGHT SURGING WAS VISIBLE FROM
BEHIND THE SOUTHEAST LIMB NEAR S14 AT THAT TIME AND WAS PROBABLY
THE SOURCE OF THE X-RAY BURST. IT MAY POSSIBLY INDICATE THE
RETURN OF OLD REGION 6958 (S17, L=340, CLASS/AREA EKI/540 ON
9 DECEMBER). NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6982, 6985, AND THE AS YET UNNUMBERED REGION
BEHIND THE EAST LIMB MAY PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY. REGION 6988
IS ALSO EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY AND MAY ALSO
PRODUCE A MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE ACTIVE LEVELS WERE BRIEF AND OCCURRED
EARLY IN THE PERIOD. AN ISOLATED PERIOD OF MINOR STORMING
OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES NEAR 30/1800Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE TOMORROW, WITH MINOR STORMING
POSSIBLE AT HIGH LATITUDES, IN RESPONSE TO THE LONG DURATION
M2/SB FLARE THAT OCCURRED AT 29/2323Z. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED
TO GRADUALLY DECLINE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF
THE PERIOD.
