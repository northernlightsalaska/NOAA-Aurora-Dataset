IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6757 (N22W76)
CONTINUED TO PRODUCE NUMEROUS LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS FLARES
WHILE DECAYING IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY. REGION 6758 (S18W79)

LOW TO MODERATE. ALTHOUGH GENERALLY C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED,
REGIONS 6757 AND 6758 PROVIDE A REASONABLE THREAT FOR M-CLASS
FLARING.
