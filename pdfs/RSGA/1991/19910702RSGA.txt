IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO AN M4/1N FLARE

6714 (N11E19) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  REGION 6703 IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MOST
LIKELY FLARE PRODUCER.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDE
STATIONS.  HIGH LATITUDES EXPERIENCED UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
CONDITIONS.  THE PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV CONTINUES
IN PROGRESS.  THE PARTICLE FLUX HAS REMAINED NEAR 90 PFU SINCE
THIS TIME YESTERDAY.  THE PCA ALSO CONTINUES IN PROGRESS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES.  THE PROTON EVENT AT
GREATER THAN 10 MEV AND THE PCA ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.
