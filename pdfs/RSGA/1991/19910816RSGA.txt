JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 228 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6786 (N09E49) PRO-
DUCED AN M6/1B FLARE AT 0621Z. IN ADDITION THIS REGION PRODUCED
AM M1/2B AT 0051Z, A C9/SF AT 1811Z, AND A C7/SN AT 1905Z, THUS
SHOWING ITSELF THE MOST FLARE PRODUCTIVE REGION ON THE DISK.
THIS GROUP IS THE LARGEST ON THE DISK AT 440 MILLIONTHS, AND
SITS TOWARD THE EASTERN END OF A LONG STRING OF SPOT GROUPS AND
PLAGE AREAS EXTENDING FROM REGION 6784 (S19E18) TO NEW REGION
6790 (N02E69). THE WHOLE AREA IS MARKED BY GROWTH AND FREQUENT
SUBFLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 6784 (S19E18) CONTINUED TO GROW TODAY
PRODUCING OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES. THE COMPLEX OF REGIONS 6781
(S18E33), 6782 (S09E35), AND 6783 (S14E31) ALSO SHOWED GROWTH
BUT PRODUCED MINIMAL FLARE ACTIVITY. THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE
SOUTHEAST WAS ALSO NOTICEABLE IN THE ENHANCED BACKGROUND X-RAY
FLUX LEVELS AND IN TODAY'S DRAMATIC 49 SFU INCREASE IN 10.7 CM
FLUX. REGION 6772 (S23W41) ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO TODAY'S ACTIVITY
WITH A C9/1N AT 1947Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH A GOOD CHANCE FOR AN M-EVENT FROM ANY OF REGIONS
6786, 6784, 6781, 6782, OR 6783. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR
ADDITIONAL MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY AS WELL, GIVEN THE CONTINUED
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE REGIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. CONDITIONS
APPEARED TO BE SUBSIDING SLIGHTLY FROM YESTERDAY'S ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM LEVEL ACTIVITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS DUE TO
PERSISTENCE AND POSSIBLE EFFECTS FROM RECENT FILAMAMENT DIS-
APPEARANCES. ACTIVITY SHOULD RETURN TO UNSETTLED LEVELS BY
THE THIRD DAY.
