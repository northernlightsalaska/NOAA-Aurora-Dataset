SDF NUMBER 314 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 NOV 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6919 (S12E50)
PRODUCED THREE M-CLASS FLARES, TWO OF WHICH REACHED THE MAJOR
CATEGORY. THE FIRST WAS AN M6/1N AT 10/0135Z AND WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH A MINOR TYPE II SWEEP. THE SECOND WAS AN M7/1N AT 10/2013Z
WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 550 SFU TENFLARE AND A MAJOR TYPE II
SWEEP. IT ALSO PRODUCED AN M2/2B FLARE AT 10/0654Z ACCOMPANIED
BY MINOR RADIO EMISSIONS. THIS REGION WAS MODERATE IN SIZE AND
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AND SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN
APPEARANCE DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 6906 (S17W81) WAS STABLE IN
TERMS OF APPEARANCE AND FLARE PRODUCTION AS IT APPROACHED THE
LIMB. REGION 6915 (N20E05) GREW AT A REDUCED RATE, COMPARED TO
YESTERDAY, AND PRODUCED NO FLARES. NEW REGIONS 6921 (N09E27) AND
6922 (S18E32) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6919 AND 6906 ARE CAPABLE OF ISOLATED
MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 6915 MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS.
A BRIEF PERIOD OF STORM LEVELS OCCURRED NEAR 10/1200Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED LEVELS BECOMING ACTIVE DURING THE
LATTER HALF OF THE FIRST DAY IN RESPONSE TO THE X1/1B FLARE OF
09/1544Z. ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH MOST
OF THE SECOND DAY DECLINING TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
