JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 106 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. SEVEN M-CLASS FLARES WERE
OBSERVED. REGION 6593 (S10E47) PRODUCED THREE OF THESE M-CLASS
FLARES. THE LARGEST WAS AN M2/SN AT 0413Z. REGION 6593 SHOWS
SOME SPOT GROWTH AND DISPLAYS A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA MAGNETIC
CONFIGURATION. REGION 6583 (N08W06) PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE
OF THE DAY. IT WAS AN M3/1B AT 1602Z. REGION 6583 ALSO DISPLAYS
A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. THE REMAINING M-CLASS
FLARES WERE OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED. THE LARGEST OF THESE FLARES
WAS AN M2 AT 0140Z. REGION 6580 (N29W47) HAS ONLY PRODUCED C-
CLASS FLARES DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD, BUT IT DOES DISPLAY A
BETA-GAMMA-DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. BRIGHT SURGING ON THE
LIMB (BSL) WAS OBSERVED AT S21W90 THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THREE
DISAPPEARING FILAMENTS WERE REPORTED MISSING IN THE NORTHWEST
QUADRANT. THE LARGEST WAS 19 DEGREES LONG AND CENTERED AT
N47W10. NEW REGION 6597 (S22E58) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY. REGION
6597 LOOKS LIKE IT HAS REVERSED POLARITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6580, 6583 AND 6593 HAVE THE
POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES. AN X-CLASS FLARE IS STILL
POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS 6583 AND 6593 IF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY
CONTINUES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO REACH ACTIVE LEVELS THE NEXT TWO DAYS, THEN
RETURN TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ON THE THIRD DAY. THE ACTIVE
LEVELS ARE FORCASTED DUE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL
HOLE.
