JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 027 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6471 (S11E53) PRO-
DUCED AN X1/1B FLARE AT 1550Z. THE EVENT WAS OF LONG DURATION,
STARTING AT 1439Z AND LASTING 85 MINUTES, AND IT WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY STRONG RADIO BURSTS, A WEAK TYPE IV, AND FLARE LOOPS. THE
SIGNATURE WAS UNUSUAL IN THAT A PRELIMINARY MAXIMUM OF M5 WAS
ATTAINED AT 1454Z BEFORE THE EVENT REACHED ITS FINAL PEAK AT X1.
THE REMAINDER OF TODAY'S EVENTS WERE LESS THAN M-LEVEL SUB-
FLARES.  REGION 6471 NOW DOMINATES THE DISK IN SIZE (1660
MILLIONTHS),  AND FLARE PRODUCTIVITY.  IT APPEARS TO HAVE A
DELTA WITH A STRONG GRADIENT IN THE TRAILER SPOT.  REGIONS
6462 (S17W05) AND 6466 (S08W00) ARE STILL IMPRESSIVE IN SIZE
AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY,  ALTHOUGH THEY PRODUCED ONLY A FEW
SMALL SUBFLARES.  A NEW REGION 6473 (S14E75) ROTATED INTO VIEW
TODAY, ACCOMPANIED BY SURGING ON THE EAST LIMB.  ADDITIONAL
SURGING WAS OBSERVED AT N15, APPARENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER
REGION THAT IS ABOUT TO ROTATE INTO VIEW. TODAY'S 10.7 FLUX HAD
TO BE ESTIMATED DUE TO INTERFERENCE FROM A STRONG RADIO BURST
IN PROGRESS AT 17Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6462, 6466, AND 6471 ALL SHOW CON-
TINUED POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE OR MAJOR FLARES. REGION 6471 IN
PARTICULAR SHOWS THE MOST POTENTIAL, GIVEN ITS HISTORY, ITS
STRONG MAGNETIC GRADIENTS AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING
SHEAR IN THE LARGE TRAILER PORTION OF THE GROUP.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. THE GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTONS WERE ENHANCED ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVEL DURING THE
DAY. THE FLUX WAS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BELOW EVENT LEVEL,
STAYING MOSTY AROUND 1 PFU.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE INCREASE IS
EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE X10 FLARE
OF 25 JANUARY, A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE, AND TODAY'S
X1 FLARE. A WEAK PROTON EVENT IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN EARLY ON THE
28TH IN RESPONSE TO TODAY'S MAJOR FLARE. THE PEAK FLUX IS EX-
PECTED TO BE ABOUT 20 PFU AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV AT ABOUT 1800Z
ON THE 28TH.
