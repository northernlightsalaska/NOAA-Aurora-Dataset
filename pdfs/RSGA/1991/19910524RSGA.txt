SDF NUMBER 144 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THREE ISOLATED C-CLASS

6644 (N19E42) AT 0310Z; AND A C2/SF FLARE FROM REGION 6646
(S13W42) AT 1852Z. REGION 6644 STANDS OUT AS THE REGION SHOWING
THE MOST EVOLUTION DURING THE PERIOD WITH INCREASED GROWTH
NOTED. VERY STRONG CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS WERE OBSERVED ON THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB TODAY GIVING CREDENCE TO THE RETURN OF OLD
REGION 6615 (S08, L-350) OR ADDITIONAL ACTIVE CENTERS. NEW
REGION 6648 (S12E67) WAS ASSIGNED.
SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 6644 POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY ACTIVE AT MIDDLE
LATITUDES WITH MINOR STORMING NOTED AT HIGH LATITUDE SITES
BETWEEN 0900-1500Z. SATELLITE LEVEL PROTONS AT GREATER THAN
10 MEV REMAINED SLIGHTLY ENHANCED ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVELS
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE WITH OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF
MINOR STORMING AT HIGHER LATITUDES DUE TO EFFECTS FROM
CORONAL HOLES.
