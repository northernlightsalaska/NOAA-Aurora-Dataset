JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 146 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. FLARE ACTIVITY CONSISTED
OF OCCASIONAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES FROM AT LEAST SIX DIFFERENT
REGIONS. REGION 6644 (N21E16) CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST
IMPRESSIVE SPOT GROUP, HAVING GROWN BY 50 PERCENT IN THE PAST
24 HOURS TO AN AREA OF ALMOST 1200 MILLIONTHS. IT IS FAIRLY
SIMPLE IN ITS MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. FIVE NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED WITH REGION 6652 (S09E69) THE LARGEST.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES COULD COME FROM
REGION 6644 IF AN INSTABILITY DEVELOPS, OR FROM THE NEW REGION
IN THE SOUTHEAST, 6652.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT MIDDLE
LATITUDES. SLIGHTLY MORE DISTURBED CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED
AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE
CURRENT CORONAL HOLE-INDUCED ACTIVITY SHOULD ABATE DURING
THE INTERVAL.
