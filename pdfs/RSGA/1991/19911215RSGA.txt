JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 349 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6961 (N09W41)
PRODUCED ONE M-CLASS FLARE, AN M1/0F AT 1425Z. NEWLY ASSIGNED
REGION 6972 (S11E68) GENERATED AN M1/1F FLARE AT 1834Z. THIS
REGION MAY BE THE RETURN OF OLD 6929 (S11, L-200) WHICH HAD 3
M-CLASS FLARES LAST ROTATION. TWO OTHER M-CLASS EVENTS, AN M1
AT 0246Z AND AN M1 AT 0626Z, WERE NOT OBSERVED. A TOTAL OF 5
NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED, THE ALREADY MENTIONED 6972, 6973
(N20W20), 6974 (S18W03), 6975 (N16W54), AND 6976 (N09W28).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AT THE MODERATE LEVEL. REGION 6961 SHOULD CONTINUE ITS
OUTPUT OF PERIODIC LOW-LEVEL M-CLASS FLARES. NEW REGION 6972,
SEEMINGLY SIMPLE IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA, HAS SHOWN ITSELF
TO BE POTENT, AND IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE AN OCCASIONAL M-CLASS
EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET SINCE EARLY IN THE
INTERVAL.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO VARY ABOUT THE ACTIVE LEVEL FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS ARE LIKELY BOTH EARLY AND LATE IN
THE FORECAST PERIOD.
