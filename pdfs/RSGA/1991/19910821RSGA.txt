HAVE HAD FEW SUBFLARES THIS PAST DAY.  NEW REGIONS 6800 (N13E58)
AND 6801 (N09E26) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 6781 IS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF
MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.  ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES ARE POSSIBLE IN
REGIONS 6782, 6784, AND 6786.
