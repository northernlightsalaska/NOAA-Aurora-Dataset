JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 083 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 6555 (S21W09)
PRODUCED AN M5/2B FLARE AT 23/2220Z, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF
SMALLER M-CLASS FLARES.  THIS REGION REMAINS COMPLEX, AND HAS
INCREASED ITS SUNSPOT PENUMBRAL AREA SINCE YESTERDAY.  REGION
6558 (S14E40) ALSO PRODUCED M-CLASS ACTIVITY, THE LARGEST FLARE
BEING AN M3/2B AT 24/0249Z.  NEW REGION 6560 (S08E12) WAS
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH.  MAJOR FLARES ARE EXPECTED IN REGION 6555.  M-CLASS
ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN REGION 6558.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO STORM LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.  STORM CONDITIONS FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF
A SSC (184 NANOTESLA AT BOULDER) AT 24/0342Z.  SEVERE STORM
CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT MOST STATIONS FOR THE THREE HOUR
PERIOD ENDING AT 24/0600Z, FOLLOWING THE SSC.  CONDITIONS WERE
MOSTLY AT MAJOR STORM LEVELS THEREAFTER.  A SECOND SHOCK
ARRIVAL WAS OBSERVED AT ABOUT 24/1930Z, AFTERWHICH THE
MAGNETOPAUSE WAS COMPRESSED TO WITHIN THE GOES SATELLITE
GEOSYNCHRNOUS ALTITUDE FOR ABOUT 90 MINUTES.  A FORBUSH
DECREASE EXCEEDED 10 PERCENT DEVIATION AT ABOUT 24/0900Z AND
CONTINUES IN PROGRESS.  THE PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV
AND POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT CONTINUE IN PROGRESS.  THE PEAK
FLUX AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV WAS 43000 AT 24/0350Z, COINCIDENT
WITH THE SSC SHOCK ARRIVAL.  THE PEAK ABSORPTION AT THE POLAR
CAP WAS 38 DB AT 24/0255Z.  ANALYSIS OF THE ENERGETIC PARTICLE
PROFILE SUGGESTS THAT THE SOURCE OF THE PROTON EVENT, AND
SUBSEQUENT SHOCK ARRIVAL, WAS THE X9/3B FLARE AT 22/2247Z.
THE LONG DURATION M6/2B AT 24/0429Z MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
SECOND SHOCK ARRIVAL AT 24/1930Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  ACTIVE
TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THEREAFTER.  THE PROTON
EVENT AND POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
FOR AT LEAST ONE MORE DAY.
