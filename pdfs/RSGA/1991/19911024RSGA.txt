JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 297 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6891 (S12E48)
GENERATED A NUMBER OF ENERGETIC FLARES, AMONG THEM AN X2/2N
AT 0240Z. ITS OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF AN M3/1N
AT 1716Z, AN M1/1F AT 0631Z, AN M1/0N AT 0948Z, AN M1/0F AT
1124Z, AND VERY LIKELY, AS A PREDECESSOR TO THE X-CLASS FLARE,
AN M1 AT 0055Z. REGION 6891 ALSO COMBINED WITH NEARBY NEIGHBOR
6892 (S21E48) TO PRODUCE AN M2 AT 1657Z. TODAY'S CLASS M AND X
OUTPUT FROM REGION 6891 EXCEEDED ITS ENTIRE M AND X OUTPUT FROM
ALL OF LAST ROTATION WHEN THE REGION WAS KNOWN AS 6850. THE
REGION IS STILL VERY LARGE AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX, AND SHOWS
NO SIGNS OF QUIETING. THE LARGE INCREASE IN TODAY'S 10.7 CM
FLUX FURTHER ATTESTS TO THE VOLATILITY OF REGION 6891. ELSE-
WHERE, REGION 6886 (N09W13) CONTINUES ITS RAPID GROWTH, BUT
PRODUCED LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FLARES. NEWLY ASSIGNED REGION
6893 (N16E69) ROTATED FULLY INTO VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6891 WILL REMAIN THE PREMIER FLARE
SITE, WITH MORE M-CLASS AND A POSSIBLE X-CLASS FLARE OCCURRING.
REGIONS 6886 AND 6892 (S21E48) MAY ALSO HAVE M-CLASS FLARES
AT SOME POINT IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
THE PAST 24 HOURS. A WELL-LOCATED NARROW CORONAL HOLE IS THE
LIKELY SOURCE OF THE ENHANCED SOLAR WIND.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY AS THE CURRENT
DISTURBANCE ABATES. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL THE
LAST TWO DAYS OF THE INTERVAL.
