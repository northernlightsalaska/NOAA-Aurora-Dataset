SDF NUMBER 128 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6621 (N09E43)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS EVENT: AN M1/SF AT 1607Z. THE
REGION SHOWED MODEST GROWTH AND IS CURRENTLY AN EAO BETA GROUP.
REGION 6619 (N30E33) PRODUCED SEVERAL SMALL FLARES TODAY. THE
MOST INTERESTING OF THESE WAS A C6/SF AT 1841Z WHICH WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP. THE REGION DOESN'T
APPEAR TO BE GROWING BUT DID SHOW SOME SPOT ROTATION AND IS
MAINTAINING A DELTA CONFIGURATION IN A LARGE (1010 MILLIONTHS)
PENUMBRAL MASS. REGION 6615 (S09W45), CONTINUED TO GROW AND IS
THE LARGEST GROUP (1640 MILLTIOTHS) ON THE DISK. IT IS ALSO
MAINTAINING ITS DELTA BUT HAD RELATIVELY COOL PLAGE AND COULD
ONLY PRODUCE SMALL C-CLASS EVENTS TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6615 CONTINUES TO BE A GOOD THREAT FOR MOD-
ERATE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, AND REGIONS 6619 AND 6621 MIGHT CON-
TRIBUTE AS WELL. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
MAJOR FLARE SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
