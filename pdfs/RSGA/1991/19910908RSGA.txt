JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 251 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 SEP 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6818 (S12W65) PRO-
DUCED AN X1/2N FLARE AT 0912Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST
DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS, A FAST TYPE II (1000 KM/S) AND A WEAK
TYPE IV RADIO SWEEP. THE EVENT WAS FAIRLY IMPULSIVE WITH A
DURATION OF 30 MINUTES. THIS GROUP SHOWS CONTINUED GROWTH
AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY IN A DELTA CONFIGURATION NEAR THE
LEADING SPOTS WHERE THE HOTTEST PLAGE AREAS WERE OBSERVED.
THERE WAS SOME INDICATION OF POSSIBLE STABILIZATION SETTING
IN NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE GROUP PRODUCED SOME AD-
DITIONAL M-CLASS LEVEL ACTIVITY: AN M2/SF AT 0154Z, AND AN
M1/SF AT 2044Z. AN ADDITIONAL UNCORRELATED M-CLASS FLARE
(AN M1) OCCURRED AT 0818Z. TWO NEW MATURE REGIONS WERE NUMBERED
TODAY: REGION 6823 (N03E17), A RAPIDLY EMERGING REGION OF
BRIGHT PLAGE WHICH PRODUCED SOME UPPER LEVEL C-CLASS ACTIVITY,
AND REGION 6824 (S21E71) WHICH SHOWED MODERATE PLAGE AND SURGE
ACTIVITY. ALSO SHOWING GOOD GROWTH AND BRIGHT PLAGE TODAY WAS
REGION 6820 (S12E02) WHICH ALSO PRODUCED OCCASIONAL UPPER LEVEL
C-CLASS EVENTS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6818 POSES THE GREATEST THREAT FOR
MODERATE OR POSSIBLY MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. NEW REGIONS 6823 AND
6824 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO MODERATE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY AS THEY
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. A STEADY UPWARD TREND IN BACKGROUND FLUX
LEVELS IS EXPECTED WITH CONTINUED REGION GROWTH AND WITH THE
RETURN OF SEVERAL OLD REGIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE MOST
NOTABLE OF THESE IS OLD REGION 6786 (S09, L=013) WHICH PRO-
DUCED 5 M-CLASS EVENTS ON ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY ACTIVE DURING THE DAY.
CONDITIONS APPEARED TO BE DECLINING SLIGHTLY TO UNSETTLED
TO ACTIVE LEVELS NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS TOMORROW, IN-
CREASING TO MOSTLY MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE SECOND
AND THIRD DAYS. THE INCREASE IS PREDICTED DUE TO POSSIBLE
EFFECTS FROM SEVERAL SOLAR SOURCES OF THE LAST FEW DAYS.
THESE ARE THE DISAPPEARING FILAMENTS OF 05 SEPTEMBER, YESTER-
DAY'S X3/2B FLARE, TODAY'S X1/2N FLARE, AND A CORONAL HOLE
WHICH WILL SOON BE MOVING INTO A FAVORABLE POSITION FOR
TERRESTRIAL EFFECTS.
