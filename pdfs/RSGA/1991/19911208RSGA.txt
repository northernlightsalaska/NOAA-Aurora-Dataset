JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 342 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. FLARE ACTIVITY INCREASED
SIGNIFICANTLY TODAY WITH REGION 6961 (N10E50) LEADING THE WAY.
CONTINUED RAPID GROWTH WAS NOTED IN THIS AREA WHICH PRODUCED
SEVERAL M-CLASS EVENTS TO INCLUDE THE LARGEST: AN M3/1B FLARE
AT 1707Z. REGION 6952 (N19E02) ALSO PRODUCED M-CLASS ACTIVITY
WHILE SHOWING SOME DECAY AND LOSS OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. AN
M1/1N FLARE WAS NOTED AT 0555Z IN REGION 6955 (N11E03). OTHER
ACTIVITY OF NOTE INCLUDES OCCASIONAL FLARING IN REGION 6958
(S17E17) AND A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM OBSERVED ON THE SOUTHEAST
LIMB WHERE X-RAY IMAGERY SUGGESTS AN ACTIVE CENTER MAY BE
EMERGING. NEW REGIONS 6964 (S22E50) AND 6965 (S06E70) WERE
ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6952 AND 6961 SHOULD CONTINUE TO
GENERATE M-CLASS FLARES. BOTH ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF AN ISOLATED
MAJOR EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH THE TREND TOWARDS
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS DUE TO EFFECTS FROM A WELL
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
