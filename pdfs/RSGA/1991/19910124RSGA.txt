JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 024 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. A COMBINED EFFORT
FROM REGIONS 6462 (S15E32) AND 6466 (S08E38) PRODUCED A LONG
DURATION M3/SN TENFLARE AT 0355Z. THESE WERE SIMULTANEOUS
FLARES OBSERVED IN EACH REGION. THE FLARES WERE NEARLY EQUAL
IN SIZE AND BRIGHTNESS, (A SN OF 83 MILLIONTHS IN 6462 AND A
SF OF 65 MILLIONTHS IN 6466) AND BOTH OBTAINED AN OPTICAL
MAXIMUM AT 0337Z. SIGNIFICANT RADIO BURSTS AND TYPE II AND
TYPE IV RADIO SWEEPS WERE ALSO RECORDED. BOTH OF THESE REGIONS
HAVE MAINTAINED GROWTH IN BOTH SPOT COUNT AND SIZE OVER THE
LAST 24 HOURS. REGION 6466 HAS DEVELOPED A STRONG DELTA
CONFIGURATION AND A FAIRLY STEEP MAGNETIC GRADIENT. THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB WAS ALSO ACTIVE TODAY. LOOPS AND AN ASSOCIATED
FLARE WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN 0739 AND 1013Z AT S14E90. A BRIGHT
SURGE, TO .19 SOLAR RADII, WAS OBSERVED AT S13E90 BETWEEN 1353
AND 1418Z. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINCE WAS REPORTED AT S27E90 BETWEEN
1035 AND 1056Z. NEW REGION 6470 (S07W62) WAS NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE GROWING COMPLEXITY OF THE 6462/6466 COMPLEX
WILL LIKELY PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL
DAYS. THERE IS ALSO A CHANCE OF MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY FROM
THIS COMPLEX. THE ACTIVITY ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB INDICATES
THAT ANOTHER REGION WILL LIKELY ROTATE ONTO THE DISK THERE
IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MIDDLE LATITUDES HAVE REPORTED SEVERAL
PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS AND SOME REPORTING STATIONS AT
HIGH LATITUDES HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS. THE CAUSE OF THIS ACTIVITY IS MOST LIKELY THE
DISAPPEARING FILAMENTS AND M-CLASS FLARES THAT HAVE BEEN
OBSERVED THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO BEGIN THE PERIOD. EFFECTS
FROM TODAYS LONG DURATION M3 ARE EXPECTED LATE ON DAY TWO
THROUGH DAY THREE OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. VERY UNSETTLED TO
ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME.
