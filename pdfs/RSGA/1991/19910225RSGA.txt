IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  M FLARE ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE FROM SEVERAL REGIONS,
THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES ARE THE REGIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST,
ESPECIALLY REGIONS 6508 (S12W14), 6509, AND 6504.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED

AT 25/1210UT, REACHED A MAX OF 13PFU AT 1305UT, AND ENDED
AT 1335UT.  THE SOURCE OF THIS EVENT IS MOST LIKELY THE
X1 FLARE FROM REGION 6497 MENTIONED IN PART IA.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED.  THERE IS A CHANCE FOR
INCREASED ACTIVITY LATE IN THE PERIOD FROM THE X1/2N FLARE AT
