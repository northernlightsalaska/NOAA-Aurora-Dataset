JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 312 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 NOV 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6906 (S16W57)
PRODUCED AN M4/1B AT 08/1712Z. THE FLARE WAS CLOSE TO THE AREA
WHERE THIS REGION AND REGION 6914 (S18W44) ARE ABUTTED. A LOOP
PROMINENCE SYSTEM AND TENFLARE OF 330 SFU WERE ASSOCIATED WITH
THE FLARE. 6906 ALSO PRODUCED 5 C-CLASS FLARES. REGION 6914 HAS
BEEN SYMPATHETICALLY FLARING WITH 6906 AND PRODUCED NUMEROUS
FLARES DURING THE PERIOD INCLUDING 7 C-CLASS EVENTS. IN TERMS OF
GROWTH, REGION 6906 HAS BEEN SLOWLY DECLINING WHILE 6914 HAS
BEEN GROWING. REGION 6915 (N19E30) DISPLAYED GROWTH AND BEGAN
PRODUCING SUBFLARES LATE IN THE PERIOD. NEW REGIONS 6918
(N21E06) AND 6919 (S11E76) WERE NUMBERED. REGION 6918 WAS
FORMERLY THE LEADER PORTION OF REGION 6908 (N21E17).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE REGION 6906/6914 COMPLEX IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
M-CLASS FLARES. C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM REGIONS 6915
AND 6919.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 17 GAMMAS
WAS RECORDED BY THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER AT 08/0647Z.
THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A JUMP TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOLLOWED BY AN
INCREASE TO MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS BETWEEN
08/1200-1500Z. THE GOES 7 MAGNETOMETER INDICATED MAGNETOPAUSE
CROSSINGS NEAR 08/1400Z, 1600Z, 1700Z, AND 2030Z. THE SOURCE
OF THIS ACTIVITY MAY HAVE BEEN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A
24 DEGREE FILAMENT FROM THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT ON 5 NOVEMBER.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT STORM LEVELS THROUGH MIDDAY TOMORROW. THE
FIELD IS THEN EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS AND
REMAIN SO FOR THE BALANCE OF THE PERIOD.
