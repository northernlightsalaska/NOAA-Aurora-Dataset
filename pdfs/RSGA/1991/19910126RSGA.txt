JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 026 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S ACTIVITY WAS CHAR-
ACTERIZED BY FREQUENT C-CLASS SUBFLARES SUPERPOSED ON AN EN-
HANCED BACKGROUND. NEARLY ALL OF THE FLARES WERE PRODUCED BY
THE DOMINANT REGIONS ON THE DISK: 6462 (S18E07), 6466 (S09E11),
AND 6471 (S11E63). 6462 IS THE LARGEST AT 1220 MILLIONTHS. IT
APPEARS TO BE FORMING TWO DELTAS: ONE JUST NORTH OF THE LARGE
LEADER SPOT, AND ANOTHER JUST WEST OF THE TRAILER SPOT. OF THE
THREE GROUPS THIS ONE FLARED MOST FREQUENTLY. REGION 6466, WHILE
PRODUCING ONLY OCCASIONAL FLARES, SHOWS A CLEAR DELTA CONFIGURA-
TION AS THE LEADER SPOT IS JOINED WITH THE MAIN TRAILER SPOT.
THERE APPEARS TO BE A SLIGHT DECAY IN THE GROUP. REGION 6471
HAS ROTATED MORE FULLY INTO VIEW AS AN EKI AT 960 MILLIONTHS.
THE GROUP DISPLAYED BRIGHT POINTS OF PLAGE, WITH OCCASIONAL
SUBFLARES. ITS NEARNESS TO THE LIMB HINDERED MAGNETIC ANALYSIS.
GRADUAL GROWTH WAS NOTED ELSEWHERE ON THE DISK, PRIMARILY FROM
6464 (N26W11), 6465 (N11W01), AND NEW REGION 6472 (N13E23).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE, BUT WITH A FAIR CHANCE FOR HIGH LEVELS AS A
RESULT OF AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR
ACTIVITY ARE REGIONS 6462, 6466 AND 6471.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A SMALL ENHANCE-
MENT WAS OBSERVED IN THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTONS, BEGIN-
NING AT ABOUT 25/2100Z AND LASTING THROUGH THE DAY. THE
GREATER THAN 10 MEV FLUX LEVEL STAYED AROUND 0.5 PFU DURING
THE DAY. THE ENHANCEMENT IS PROBABLY FROM THE X10 FLARE OF
25 JANUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TOMORROW. AN INCREASE TO ACTIVE
CONDITIONS IS EXPECTED LATE TOMORROW, CONTINUING ON THROUGH THE
SECOND DAY AND LASTING PARTWAY THROUGH THE THIRD DAY IN RE-
SPONSE TO THE X10 FLARE OF 25 JANUARY. CONDITIONS SHOULD DECLINE
TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS THEREAFTER.
