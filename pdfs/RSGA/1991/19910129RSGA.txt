JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 029 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6479 (N07E61)
PRODUCED AN M1/SF AT 28/2101Z AND REGION 6471 (S10E28) PRODUCED
AN M1/SN AT 1018Z. SURPRISINGLY, REGION 6479 APPEARS TO BE A
SIMPLE BXO GROUP AND HAS BEEN QUIET SINCE THE M-FLARE. REGION
6471 IN CONTRAST, CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST ON THE DISK AT
1590 MILLIONTHS. THE SPOTS HAVE COMBINED INTO A SINGLE COMPACT
PENUMBRAL CONFIGURATION WHICH SHOWS STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS AND
GRADIENTS ACROSS A FAIRLY SIMPLE NORTH-SOUTH INVERSION LINE,
FORMING A DELTA CONFIGURATION. REGION 6469 (S13W10) WAS ALSO
FLARE PRODUCTIVE AND SHOWED STEADY GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD.
REGIONS 6462 (S18E31) AND 6466 (S09W26) SHOWED SOME SLIGHT
DECAY AND RELAXATION. REGION 6462'S CONFIGURATION, HOWEVER,
SHOWS SOME POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING SHEAR ON THE SOUTHWEST
CORNER OF THE BIG TRAILER SPOT, AND THIS COULD INITIATE A
NEW SERIES OF FLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 6476 (N07E61) SHOWED
NEARLY FLARE BRIGHT PLAGE FOR MUCH OF THE DAY, AND ACCOUNTS
FOR SOME OF TODAY'S ENHANCED BACKGROUND LEVELS. TODAY'S 10.7
FLUX SHOT UP AGAIN TO 353, THE HIGHEST LEVEL OBSERVED SINCE
DECEMBER 23, 1957.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6471 CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCE FOR ENERGETIC FLARES. REGION 6462 ALSO SHOWS SOME PRO-
MISE AS A SOURCE OF M-FLARES AND POSSIBLY MAJOR FLARES. REGIONS
6466, 6465, 6469, AND 6476 ARE POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR ISOLATED
M-FLARES, AND PROBABLY WILL PRODUCE OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV
PROTONS REMAINED ENHANCED WITH A MAXIMUM OF 5 PFU AT 28/2335Z.
FLUX JEVELS ARE DECLINING TO BACKGROUND LEVELS AT THIS TIME.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED. EFFECTS FROM THE SOLAR
FLARE OF 27 JANUARY DID NOT MATERIALIZE AND ARE NO LONGER
EXPECTED.
