JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 212 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6749 (S17W04)
PRODUCED AN X2/2B FLARE AT 31/0052Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
590 SFU TENFLARE AND WEAK TYPES II AND IV SWEEPS. THE REGION
SHOWED GRADUAL GROWTH AND MAY HAVE DEVELOPED A DELTA MAGNETIC
CONFIGURATION. REGION 6739 (N01W67) PRODUCED AN M1/SN FLARE AT
31/0822Z. REGION 6757 (N22E29) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH WHILE
PRODUCING SEVERAL SUBFLARES, A FEW OF WHICH REACHED C-CLASS.
THIS REGION MAY ALSO HAVE DEVELOPED A DELTA MAGNETIC
CONFIGURATION. REGIONS 6734 (N11W82) AND 6741 (N11W66) CONTINUED
TO GRADUALLY DECAY. A LARGE, QUIESCENT HEDGEROW PROMINENCE
WAS VISIBLE ON THE NORTHEAST LIMB EXTENDING FROM N13 TO N42. NO
NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6749 AND 6757 ARE CAPABLE OF
PRODUCING M-CLASS FLARES. BOTH REGIONS ALSO POSE A SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR X-CLASS FLARING. REGION 6734 MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE AND POSES A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MAJOR
FLARE ACTIVITY AS IT BEGINS TO CROSS THE WEST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED. THE X2/2B FLARE IS NOT EXPECTED TO
SIGNIFICANTLY DISTURB THE FIELD.
