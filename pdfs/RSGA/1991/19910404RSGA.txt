OF A SI (70 NANOTESLAS AT BOULDER) AT 04/1121Z. MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES WITH MAJOR
STORMING EVIDENT AT HIGH LATITUDE SITES. THE SATELLITE LEVEL
PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN 03/0815Z CONTINUED IN PROGRESS THROUGH
THE END OF THE PERIOD. A TENTATIVE PEAK OF 52 PFU AT GREATER
THAN 10 MEV WAS OBSERVED AT 04/1000Z. A PCA EVENT BEGAN AT
04/0845Z, REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 2.2 DB AT 04/1000Z (COINCIDENT
WITH THE TENTATIVE PROTON FLUX PEAK), AND ENDED AT 04/1750Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS
WITH GENERALLY ACTIVE TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS LIKELY THE
