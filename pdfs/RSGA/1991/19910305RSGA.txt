JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 064 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY HIGH. NEW REGION 6538
(S23E77) PRODUCED AN M6/2B AT 05/0009Z, AN X1/3N AT 05/0312Z,
AND AN X2/3B AT 05/0914Z. MODEST RADIO EMISSIONS ACCOMPANIED
THESE FLARES. BRIGHT SURGING AND LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEMS WERE
OBSERVED IN THE REGION THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AS IT CONTINUED TO
ROTATE INTO VIEW. ITS LIMB PROXIMITY PREVENTED AN ACCURATE
ASSESSMENT OF ITS SIZE AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. AN OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED M9 X-RAY BURST OCCURRED AT 05/0506Z AND WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH A 720 SFU TENFLARE. REGION 6537 (S09E66)
PRODUCED AN X1/2B AT 05/1721Z ACCOMPANIED BY BRIGHT SURGING AND
MINOR RADIO EMISSIONS. NEW REGION 6539 (N20E45) WAS ALSO
NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. MAJOR FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM REGION 6538. THERE IS ALSO
A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE FROM REGION 6537.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING
OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE
PERIOD. THE CAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY IS UNKOWN AT THIS TIME.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND AT
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE ACTIVE
LEVELS ARE EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
