JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 157 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY HIGH. THE PREMIER EVENT
OF THE PERIOD WAS AN X12 (PLUS)/3B TENFLARE FROM REGION 6659
(N32E32) AT 06/0108Z. THE EVENT SATURATED THE GOES X-RAY SENSOR
AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS. THE
TENFLARE WAS MEASURED AT 55,000 SFU. THIS REGION CONTINUED TO
GROW IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY DURING THE PERIOD. REGIONS 6666
(S17E46) AND 6667 (N12E11) CONTRIBUTED LOW LEVEL M-CLASS EVENTS
DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 6666 DISPLAYED NOTABLE GROWTH AND
COMPLEXITY. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. MORE M-CLASS EVENTS AND ISOLATED X-CLASS ACTIVITY IS
POSSIBLE FROM REGION 6659. REGIONS 6666 AND 6667 MAY CONTRIBUTE
ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MINOR TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD UNTIL 1500Z WHEN
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS BECAME PREVALENT. THE
SEVERE STORM WHICH BEGAN NEAR 0600Z ON 5 JUNE PRODUCED
MAGNETIC INDICES SECOND TO THOSE OBSERVED DURING THE
ACTIVITY OF MARCH 1989. THE SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON EVENT AT
GREATER THAN 10 MEV WHICH BEGAN 04/0820Z CONTINUED IN
PROGRESS THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.  A TENTATIVE PEAK OF
130 PFU WAS OBSERVED AT 06/1045Z. THE NEW ENHANCED PEAK WAS
DUE TO EFFECTS FROM THE MAJOR FLARING NOTED ABOVE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH
EFFECTS FROM THE RECENT MAJOR FLARING POSSIBLY BEGINNING LATE
ON THE 7TH. THE PROTON EVENT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR THE
NEXT 24-48 HOURS.
