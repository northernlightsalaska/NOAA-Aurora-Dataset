JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 213 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6749 (S16W16)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE DAY: AN M4/2B PARALLEL RIBBON
FLARE AT 01/1521Z. A 300 SFU TENFLARE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
FLARE. REGION 6757 (S23E14) CONTINUED TO GROW AT A MODERATE PACE
AND PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 31/2258Z AND AN M2/SF AT 01/1453Z. BOTH
FLARES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY MINOR DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. THE
LARGE HEDGEROW PROMINENCE MENTIONED IN SDF 212 ERUPTED AT
01/1530Z AND REACHED OUT TO .32 SOLAR RADII. REGION 6734
(N11W96) QUIETLY CROSSED THE LIMB. A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM WAS
OBSERVED IN REGION 6737 (S13W96) AT 01/0035-0316Z AS IT CROSSED
THE LIMB. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6757 IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES AND MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE. REGION
6749 IS ALSO CAPABLE OF M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS BEEN QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
UNTIL 01/1500Z. THEREAFTER, THE FIELD INCREASED TO ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM LEVELS POSSIBLY IN RESPONSE TO THE X2/2B FLARE OF
31/0052Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS TOMORROW WITH ISOLATED
PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING POSSIBLE AS FLARE EFFECTS SUBSIDE.
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES ARE EXPECTED FOR THE
REST OF THE PERIOD DUE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
