JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 296 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6891 (S12E62) NOW
REVEALS ITSELF TO BE AN ELONGATED MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX ACTIVE
REGION, MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 2000 MILLIONTHS IN WHITE LIGHT
AREA. HOWEVER, ITS FLARE OUTPUT TODAY WAS MINIMAL, CONSISTING
OF JUST OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES. REGION 6886 (N09E02) GREW
SUBSTANTIALLY IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA. THE OTHER FIVE SPOT
GROUPS WERE UNIMPRESSIVE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6891 IS SO LARGE AND OMINOUS THAT M-CLASS
FLARES MUST BE ANTICIPATED.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS UNTIL
ABOUT 1800Z. ACTIVE CONDITIONS OCCURRED THE PAST THREE HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS THE NEXT 48 HOURS.
A NARROW CORONAL HOLE MAY CAUSE THIS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED LEVEL
OF ACTIVITY. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO END THE PERIOD.
