REMAINED STABLE UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE PERIOD WHEN AN M5/2B
FLARE ERUPTED AT 15/2100Z. MODEST RADIO EMISSIONS AND A TENFLARE
OF 220 FLUX UNITS ACCOMPANIED THIS EVENT. NEW REGIONS 6680
(S15E20), 6681 (N09E74), AND 6682 (S12E29) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6659 MAY PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY OR
AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE AS IT ROUNDS THE WEST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH

THAT BEGAN 14/2340Z, BECAME ENHANCED NEAR 0845Z IN RESPONSE
TO EFFECTS FROM THE MAJOR FLARING NOTED IN PART IA. A
TENTATIVE PEAK OF 1200 PFU WAS OBSERVED AT 1700Z. THE
GREATER THAN 100 MEV PROTONS REACHED A PEAK OF 69 PFU AT
0955Z. A POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT BEGAN NEAR 0900Z. A
GROUND LEVEL EVENT OCCURRED BETWEEN 0900-1100Z WITH A PEAK
INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OBSERVED NEAR 0930Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT THE START OF THE PERIOD.
STORM CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE BEGINNING EARLY ON THE 17TH IN
