JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 074 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6545 (S09E12)
PRODUCED AN M1/0F AT 0330Z, AN M1/1B AT 0406Z, AND ANOTHER M1/1B
AT 0743Z. IT ALSO HAD NUMEROUS C-CLASS SUBFLARES. ALTHOUGH LESS
EXPLOSIVE THAN PREVIOUS DAYS, THE REGION MAY BE DISSIPATING
STORED ENERGY BY MORE FREQUENT BUT LESS INTENSE FLARE ACTIVITY.
IT IS STILL SEEN TO BE A BETA-GAMMA DELTA MAGNETIC TYPE.
REGION 6538 (S23W43) GENERATED C-CLASS SUBFLARES AT A QUICKER
CADENCE THAN YESTERDAY. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED,
6549 (S03E66) AND 6550 (S18E70).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6545 SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A THREAT
FOR ADDITIONAL X-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE FLARE-RELATED DISTURBANCE ANTICIPATED
TO BEGIN TODAY HAS NOT OCCURRED. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV
PROTON ENHANCEMENT AND THE FORBUSH DECREASE ARE ONGOING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT 24
HOURS. AN INTERPLANETARY SHOCK MAY STILL IMPACT THE GEOMAG-
NETIC FIELD IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ALTHOUGH THE PROBABILITY OF
THAT OCCURRENCE IS DECREASED.
