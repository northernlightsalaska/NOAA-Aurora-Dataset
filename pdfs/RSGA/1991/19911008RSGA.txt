JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 281 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  HOWEVER, 9 C-CLASS
EVENTS OCCURRED AND SUBFAINT FLARES WERE OBSERVED IN 7
SEPARATE REGIONS.  FIVE NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED.  THESE
WERE REGIONS 6869 (S09E13), 6870 (N12E18), 6871 (S11E64),
6872 (N07E74), AND 6873 (S23E75).  OF THESE NEW REGIONS,
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS 6873 WHICH IS THE RETURN OF OLD
REGION 6835.  EXTREMELY INTENSE CALCIUM XV EMISSION WAS
REPORTED OVER THE SOUTHEAST LIMB ABOVE REGION 6873, AND
SURGING WAS SEEN ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB NEAR S12 AND S24.
SURGING WAS ALSO OBSERVED ON THE SOUTHWEST LIMB NEAR
DEPARTING REGION 6850 (S12W90).  THE MOST ACTIVE REGION ON
THE DISK WAS REGION 6861 (N07W47) WHICH PRODUCED A C9/SF FLARE
AT 1522 UT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  HOWEVER, DEVELOPMENT IN REGIONS 6861 AND 6873 COULD
LEAD TO INCREASED FLARE POTENTIAL IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR
STORM LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THIS PERSISTENT
ACTIVITY IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE EFFECTS OF A NEGATIVE
POLARITY CORONAL HOLE THAT CROSSED CENTRAL MERIDIAN ON
5 OCTOBER.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY
IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE FROM PRESENT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS TOWARD GENERALLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS DURING THE
NEXT THREE DAYS.  ISOLATED PERIODS AT ACTIVE OR MINOR STORM
LEVELS ESPECIALLY AT HIGH GEOMAGNETIC LATITUDES ARE LIKELY
DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS.
