JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 350 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6961 (N09W54)
PRODUCED A VERY IMPULSIVE M6/0N TENFLARE AT 1927Z. MODERATE
BURSTS ACROSS THE RADIO SPECTRUM WERE OBSERVED, INCLUDING 740
FLUX UNITS AT 2695 MHZ. EARLIER IN THE INTERVAL THIS REGION HAD
AN M2/0F AT 0459Z. SIMILAR TO THE PAST FEW DAYS, SOME OF THE
DAY'S M-LEVEL FLARES WERE NOT OBSERVED. THESE WERE A LONG
DURATION M3 AT 1312Z, AN M1 AT 0641Z, AND ANOTHER M1, THIS AT
1204Z. STRONG RADIO EMISSION, SEEN AT EAST LIMB IN THE 10 CM.
EAST-WEST SCAN, ARGUES FOR A HOT ACTIVE REGION SOON TO APPEAR
AND A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF THESE OPTICALLY UNASSOCIATED EVENTS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6961 AND 6972 (S11E58) ARE THE MOST LIKELY
DISK REGIONS TO YIELD M-CLASS EVENTS, AND WATCH EAST LIMB FOR
PERHAPS ANOTHER VOLATILE REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET UNTIL MIDWAY THROUGH THE
PERIOD. CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS WERE ANTICIPATED AND ARE THOUGHT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS NOW BEING
OBSERVED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM LEVELS OVER
THE NEXT THREE DAYS. ADDITIONAL EFFECTS FROM ANOTHER CORONAL
HOLE ARE DUE 18 DECEMBER.
