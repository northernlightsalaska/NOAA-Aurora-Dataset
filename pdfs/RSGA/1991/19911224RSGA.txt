SDF NUMBER 358 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6982 (S13E03)
PRODUCED AN X1/2B FLARE AT 24/1024Z. THIS FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY A 2695 MHZ RADIO BURST OF 460 SFU. THIS REGION REMAINS LARGE
AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. REGION 6985 (S16E50) IS THE LARGEST
AND POSSIBLY THE MOST COMPLEX REGION ON THE DISK, BUT HAS NOT
PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY DURING THE PAST DAY. NEW REGION
6988 (S14E67) ROTATED INTO VIEW DIRECTLY EAST OF 6985. THIS
REGION IS ALSO LARGE AND IS POSITIONED WELL FOR INTERACTION
WITH 6985.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. MAJOR FLARES ARE EXPECTED IN REGIONS 6982,
6985, AND 6988.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. ISOLATED
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT SOME HIGH
LATITUDE STATIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
