JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 075 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6545 (S08W00),
STILL THE DOMINANT ACTIVE REGION, PRODUCED A NUMBER OF ENERGETIC
FLARES. THEY WERE AN X1/2B TENFLARE WITH TYPES II AND IV SWEEPS
AT 0052Z; AN M4/1B TENFLARE AT 1054Z; AN M2/0N AT 15/2234Z; AND
AN M1/1B AT 1807Z. THE REGION HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY IN WHITE LIGHT
WHILE RETAINING A MODERATE DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
REGION 6538 (S23W54) REEMERGED AS A FLARE PRODUCER WITH A C8/0F
AT 2010Z, FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY AN M1/1N AT 2054Z. TWO NEW REGIONS
WERE ASSIGNED, 6551 (N21E25) AND 6552 (S20W33). BRIGHT SURGING
WAS SEEN AT EAST LIMB NEAR S20 WHERE OLD REGION 6509 (S22,
L-194) IS DUE. THIS REGION HAD NUMEROUS SMALL FLARES LAST
ROTATION, BUT IS SITUATED IN AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN ACTIVE THE
PAST 4 ROTATIONS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6545 SHOULD CONTINUE TO YIELD PERIODIC
X-CLASS ACTIVITY, AND NEWLY RESURGENT REGION 6538 MAY
CONTRIBUTE SOME M-CLASS FLARES OF ITS OWN.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET. RECENT FLARES HAVE
HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE MAGNETOSPHERE. THE SMALL FORBUSH
DECREASE AND THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON ENHANCEMENT
CONTINUE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. HIGH LATITUDES
ARE FORECAST TO BE AT MINOR STORM CONDITIONS. THERE IS A SMALL
BUT FINITE CHANCE OF A FLARE-INDUCED DISTURBANCE AT SOME POINT
IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
