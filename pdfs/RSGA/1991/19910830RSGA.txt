SDF NUMBER 242 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6811 (S20E38)
PRODUCED AN M2/1B FLARE AT 30/0119Z. OCCASIONAL C-CLASS EVENTS
WERE ALSO OBSERVED FROM THIS AREA WHICH HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICANT
GROWTH IN SPOT AREA COUPLED WITH INCREASED MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
REGIONS 6812 (N12E10) AND 6807 (S08W09) DISPLAYED MODEST GROWTH
WHILE CONTRIBUTING SUBFLARES AND C-CLASS EVENTS RESPECTIVELY.
THIS PAIR OF REGIONS IS ALSO INCREASING IN MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
REGION 6805 (N24W00) IS SLOWLY DECAYING WITH FRAGMENTATION IN
ITS LEADING SPOT AREA OBSERVED. THIS REGION PRODUCED ONLY
ISOLATED SUBFLARES DURING THE PERIOD. NO NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6805, 6807, 6811, AND 6812 ARE ALL CAPABLE OF
M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE TO STORM CONDITIONS
BECAME DOMINANT FROM 1200Z THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.
