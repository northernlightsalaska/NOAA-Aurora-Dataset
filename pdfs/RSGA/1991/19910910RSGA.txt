JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 253 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 SEP 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M1 X-RAY FLARE WAS
OBSERVED AT 2057Z. OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS WERE QUITE LIMITED DUR-
ING THE PERIOD AND WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS FLARE. A LONG
DURATION C6 FLARE WAS OBSERVED FROM 0634Z TO 0923Z, AND MAY HAVE
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM OBSERVED ON EAST
LIMB AT N02 FROM 0858-0912Z. A FEW ADDITIONAL C-CLASS EVENTS
WERE OBSERVED DURING THE DAY, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH WERE NOT SEEN
OPTICALLY. SURGING WAS OBSERVED WITH THE DEPARTURE OF REGION
6818 (S13W88). A NEW MATURE REGION 6827 (S19E65) ROTATED INTO
VIEW TODAY. REGIONS 6820 (S11W25) AND 6823 (N02W10) SHOWED SOME
MODERATION OF PLAGE AND POSSIBLE STABILIZATION FROM THEIR
INITIAL RAPID GROWTH PHASES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6818 MAY CONTRIBUTE TO M-LEVEL ACTIVITY
FOR PERHAPS ONE MORE DAY. IN ADDITION REGIONS 6820, 6823, AND
6824 MAY ALSO PRODUCE ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS INITIALLY AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD THROUGH ABOUT 0900Z.
THE DISTURBANCE HAS SUBSIDED SINCE THEN WITH PREDOMINANTLY
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS BEING OBSERVED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS OVER THE NEXT
THREE DAYS. THE EFFECTS ARE EXPECTED AS A POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE
OF THE X1 FLARE OF 08 SEPTEMBER AND AS A RESULT OF RECURRENT
CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
