JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 130 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M1/SF FROM REGION
6615 (S10W71) AT 1949UT WAS THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE DAY.
REGION 6619 (N29E11) HAS BEEN THE BUSIEST OF THE DAY PRODUCING
NUMEROUS C-CLASS AND SUBFLARES, INCLUDING AN INTERESTING THREE
PEAKED FLARE WHICH CULMINATED AT C7/SF AT 0338UT. NEW REGION
6627 (S18W64) EMERGED JUST SOUTHEAST OF REGION 6615.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN REGION 6615 AND NEW REGION
6627 SHOULD PROVIDE THE GREATEST CHANCE OF MODERATE ACTIVITY
AND ISOLATED MAJOR FLARING. SEVERAL OTHER REGIONS, INCLUDING
6619 AND 6621 (N10E19) REMAIN RESPECTABLE AND APPEAR CAPABLE OF
ADDING ADDITIONAL M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THERE WERE SEVERAL PERIODS OF
ACTIVE CONDITIONS AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM 0900-1500UT. A
SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON ENHANCEMENT BEGAN AROUND 0200UT AND
CONTINUES IN PROGRESS AT ABOUT 4 PFU. THE SOURCE OF THIS
ENHANCEMENT IS NOT READILY APPARENT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS
ARE POSSIBLE THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO YESTERDAY'S
DISAPPEARING FILAMENT. CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN TO MOSTLY
UNSETTLED THEREAFTER. SINCE THE SOURCE OF THE PROTON
ENHANCEMENT IS NOT DETERMINED, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT
WHETHER IT WILL REACH EVENT CRITERIA. HOWEVER, FROM ITS
PRESENT RATE OF INCREASE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IT WILL,
OR WILL BE A VERY SMALL EVENT.
