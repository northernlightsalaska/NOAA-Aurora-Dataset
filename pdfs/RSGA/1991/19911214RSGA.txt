JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 348 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6958 (S18W61)
GENERATED AN M1/2N FLARE AT 0717Z, ITS ONLY FLARE OF THE PERIOD.
THE OTHER M-CLASS EVENTS WERE BOTH UNSEEN; AN M1 AT 1451Z AND AN
M2 AT 2058Z. FURTHER INFORMATION MAY BE FORTHCOMING ON THIS VERY
RECENT M2. REGION 6961 (N09W28) WAS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE REGION
IN THE PAST 24 HOURS. ALTHOUGH IT FAILED TO ATTAIN M-CLASS WITH
ITS EFFORTS, IT DID YIELD A C9/0N WITH IMPORTANCE 3 TYPE II
SWEEP AT 0106Z, AND A C8/1N WITH IMPORTANCE 2 TYPE II AT 0553Z.
ELSEWHERE, FREQUENT SURGING AND SMALL LIMB EVENTS WERE OBSERVED
NEAR SE10. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED, 6970 (S12W54) AND 6971
(S27W05).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE AT MODERATE LEVELS. REGIONS 6958 AND 6961 ARE THE
BEST CANDIDATES FOR OCCASIONAL M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOMEWHAT ELEVATED ACTIVITY
IS ANTICIPATED 16 DECEMBER WHEN CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS ARE DUE.
