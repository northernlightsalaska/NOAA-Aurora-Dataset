JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 080 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6555 (S24E30) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY MAJOR FLARE: AN X1/1N AT 2026Z WHICH WAS AC-
COMPANIED BY MODERATE TO WEAK RADIO BURSTS. THE EVENT HAD SMALL
INTEGRATED FLUX AND WAS FAIRLY IMPULSIVE. THIS GROUP NOW DOMIN-
ATES THE DISK AND SIZE, COMPLEXITY AND FLARE PRODUCTION. AD-
DITIONAL M-CLASS EVENTS FROM THIS GROUP WERE AN M1/2B AT 0055Z,
AN M1/SN AT 0553Z, AN M2/2B AT 1041Z, AN M1/SN AT 1247Z, AND
AN M1/1N AT 1516Z. REGION 6545 (S08W73) PRODUCED ONE M-CLASS
EVENT, AN M2/1B AT 0817Z AS IT APPROACHED WEST LIMB. IT SHOULD
BE NOTED, HOWEVER THAT REGION 6555 WAS ALSO FLARING AT THE TIME
BUT DID NOT REACH ITS PEAK OF 2B UNTIL 0825Z, HENCE THE PRI-
MARY ASSOCIATION WITH 6545. THE OTHER ACTIVE REGIONS WERE
QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE WITH A CONTINUED CHANCE FOR ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE
ACTIVITY. REGIONS 6555 IS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE MOST OF THE FLARE
PRODUCTION, BUT 6545 COULD STILL PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO STORM LEVELS OVER
THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE FIELD WAS INTIALLY QUIET UNTIL A SUD-
DEN IMPULSE OCCURRED AT 06Z. THE IMPULSE MEASURED 25 GAMMA
IN BOULDER. THE FIELD WAS UNSETTLED FROM 06-12Z BUT WAS
FOLLOWED BY A THREE HOUR STORM PERIOD FROM 12-16Z, WITH
MID-LATITUDES AT MINOR STORM LEVELS, AND HIGH LATITUDES
AT MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS. CONDITIONS RETURNED TO
GENERALLY UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. THE
DISTRUBANCE COULD HAVE ORIGINATED FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES,
BUT THE M6 FLARE OF 19 MARCH AT 0200Z SEEMS TO BE THE MOST
LIKELY CAUSE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED WITH SOME ISOLATED ACTIVE
PERIODS TOMORROW, AND IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY DECLINE TO
MOSTLY UNSETTLED ON THE SECOND DAY, AND QUIET TO UNSETTLED BY
THE THIRD DAY.
