JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 199 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. AN X1 LIMB FLARE
MAXED AT 1441Z BEHIND N06E90.  STRONG FLARE LOOPS ROSE
ABOVE THE LIMB, AND MATERIAL SPRAYED OUT TO .54 SOLAR
RADII.  ASSOCIATED RADIO SWEEPS AND BURSTS WERE NOT
SIGNIFICANT.  THE FLARE REGION, NUMBERED AS 6734, IS
THE PROBABLE RETURN OF OLD REGION 6694 WHICH PRODUCED
FIVE C-CLASS FLARES LAST ROTATION.  ON THE DISK, REGION
6728 (S26W01) PRODUCED AN M3/1F TENFLARE (290 FLUX UNITS)
AT 2132Z.  IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERATE TYPE IV SWEEP.
REGION 6729 (S21E21) HAS BEEN THE SITE OF SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES
TODAY.  THREE OTHER NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED. REGIONS
6732 (S30W40) AND 6735 (S08E49) DEVELOPED ON THE DISK.
NEITHER ARE ERUPTIVE AT THIS TIME.  REGION 6733 (S07E76)
ROTATED OVER THE EAST LIMB.  ANOTHER REGION MAY BE JUST
BEHIND THIS ONE, AND BOTH ARE NEAR THE LOCATION OF OLD
REGION 6693 WHICH PRODUCED M-CLASS FLARES LAST ROTATION.
OTHER LIMB AND DISK ACTIVITY INCLUDED SURGING NEAR S22E90,
S13E90, AND AN ACTIVE PROMINENCE NEAR S28W90.  THERE WERE
TWO FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCES:  A DARK FILAMENT NEAR
N20E10 (17/1400Z-18/1400Z), AND PART OF AN ACTIVE DARK
FILAMENT ASSOCIATED WITH REGION 6728 (18/1606Z-1754Z).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  NEW REGION 6734 APPARENTLY THREATENS SIGNIFICANT
FLARES, AND REGIONS 6728 AND 6729 CONTINUE TO ERUPT DESPITE
THEIR LACK OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS RANGED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THE MOST DISTURBED PERIOD
OBSERVED BY NORTH AMERICAN MAGNETOMETERS OCCURRED BETWEEN
00-03Z TODAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THIS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO HIGH SPEED
SOLAR WIND FROM CORONAL HOLES, THE MAJOR FLARES OF THE PAST
2 DAYS, AND THE FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE FROM N20E10 OBSERVED
TODAY.
