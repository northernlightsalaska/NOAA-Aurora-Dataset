JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 357 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6982 (S13E17)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE PAST DAY, A LONG-DURATION
M4/2N PEAKING AT 23/1240Z. THIS REGION REMAINS LARGE IN SUNSPOT
AREA WITH MODERATE MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. REGION 6985 (S16E66) IS
THE LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK AND APPEARS TO BE MORE COMPLEX
THAN 6982. THIS REGION MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE M4 FLARE
MENTIONED ABOVE. ADDITIONAL SPOTS ARE ROTATING AROUND THE LIMB
BEHIND 6985 AND ARE PROBABLY PART OF A SEPARATE REGION. FINAL
REGION DEFINITIONS WILL NOT BE MADE UNTIL ALL OF THE SPOTS ARE
IN VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. MAJOR FLARES ARE POSSIBLE IN REGIONS 6982
AND 6985.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES
AND UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES. ISOLATED STORM
CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
