JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 155 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6659 (N31E55) PRO-
DUCED ANOTHER GIANT FLARE: AN X12+/3B THAT SATURATED THE SENSORS
FROM 0342-0401Z AND WAS OF LONG DURATION, ENDING AT 0800Z. THE
EVENT HAD OUTSTANDING DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS AND A STRONG TYPE IV
ASSOCIATED. THE GROUP ALSO PRODUCED AN M1 AT 2014Z. THE REGION
CONSISTS OF A LARGE PRIMARY PENUMBRAL AREA OF ABOUT 1300 MIL-
LIONTHS WITH A DELTA ON THE SOUTHEAST CORNER, THE APPARENT CAUSE
OF THE DRAMATIC FLARES SEEN SO FAR. THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY'S
EVENTS CONSISTED OF A FEW SMALL C-CLASS EVENTS. NOTABLE GROWTH
WAS OBSERVED IN NEW REGION 6667 (N12E37) AND GROWTH CONTINUES
IN 6648 (S14W65). REGION 6652 (S10W48) HAS LOST ITS DELTA AND
CONTINUES TO DECAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. REGION 6659 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL ISOLATED
MAJOR FLARES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
TO M-CLASS LEVEL ACTIVITY ARE POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS 6652 AND
6648.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS.
CONDITIONS WERE INITIALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED UNTIL ABOUT 1400Z.
AT THAT TIME A SUDDEN COMMENCENT TYPE OF SHOCK WAS OBSERVED AT
SEVERAL MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES AND WAS FOLLOWED BY THE ONSET
OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS AT MID-LATITUDES AND MAJOR TO
SEVERE STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE DISTURBANCE WAS
SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE TO CAUSE GOES-6 AND GOES-7 TO EXPERIENCE
MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSINGS FROM ABOUT 1715-1800Z. A GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTON EVENT BEGAN AT 04/0820Z. A CLEAR ENHANCEMENT OF
THESE PARTICLES UP TO 94 PFU WAS OBSERVED AT 1535Z, COR-
RESPONDING TO THE SHOCK EVENT MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. THE MOST
LIKELY SOURCE FOR THE SHOCK EVENT AND SUBSEQUENT MAGNETIC
DISTURBANCE IS THE X12+ FLARE OF 01 JUNE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED
ALSO THAT THE GREATER THAN 100 MEV PARTICLES BEGAN TO RISE
AROUND 1630Z AND HAD REACHED ABOUT 0.5 PFU BY THE PERIOD'S END.
THE TIME OF ARRIVAL AND THE STEADY SLOW RISE OF THESE
PARTICLES SUGGEST THAT THEY ORIGINATED FROM TODAY'S MAJOR
SOLAR FLARE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT 12-24 HOURS. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE THERE-
AFTER UNTIL SOMETIME EARLY ON THE THIRD DAY. AN ADDITIONAL
PERIOD OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS IS EXPECTED AT THAT TIME AS
A RESPONSE TO TODAY'S MAJOR SOLAR FLARE.
