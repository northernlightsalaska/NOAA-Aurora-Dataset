JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 105 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6593 (S10E60) PRO-
DUCED AN M9/2F FLARE AT 0942Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WEAK TO
MODERATE RADIO BURSTS. THIS REGION HAS ROTATED MORE FULLY INTO
VIEW AS A 470 MILLIONTHS DKO BETA-DELTA GROUP AND PRODUCED MOST
OF TODAY'S M-CLASS EVENTS: AN M2/2B AT 1438Z AND AN M4/1B AT
1557Z. STRONG CALCIUM EMISSION WAS OBSERVED ON THE LIMB IN
ASSOCIATION WITH THIS GROUP. THE FINAL M-CLASS EVENT OF THE DAY
WAS AN M3/1N AT 1908Z FROM REGION 6583 (N08E08). THIS REGION
REMAINS THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK AND MAINTAINS ITS MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY BUT SHOWED SOME DECAY DURING THE DAY. MODEST GROWTH
WAS NOTED IN REGIONS 6580 (N29W36) AND 6582 (S25W11). SURGING
AND STRONG CALCIUM EMISSION WERE NOTED ON WEST LIMB AT ABOUT
S10 ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPARTURE OF REGION 6570 (S10W85). NEW
REGIONS 6595 (S31E60) AND 6596 (S21E67) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE. REGION 6593 IS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR AC-
TIVITY, ALTHOUGH REGION 6583 CERTAINLY REMAINS POTENT AND COULD
CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY. THERE IS A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
MAJOR FLARE SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. FLUX LEVELS
SHOULD DROP GRADUALLY AS REGION 6583 DECAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TOMORROW, BECOMING MOSTLY ACTIVE ON
THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS. THE INCREASE IS FORECAST BECAUSE A
CORONAL HOLE WILL BE FAVORABLY POSITIONED ON THOSE DAYS.
