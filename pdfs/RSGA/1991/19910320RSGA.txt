JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 079 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6555 (S24E41) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY MAJOR FLARE, AN M7/1N AT 0617Z WHICH WAS
IMPULSIVE AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WEAK RADIO BURSTS. THIS REGION
PRODUCED ADDITIONAL ENERGETIC ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS: AN M2/2N AT
0016Z AND AN M1/SN AT 1821Z. THE GROUP HAS ROTATED MORE FULLY
INTO VIEW AND IS A LARGE 2270 MILLIONTHS FKI GROUP WITH AN EAST-
WEST INVERSION LINE IN A MAGNETIC BETA CONFIGURATION. REGION
6545 (S08W57) ALSO PRODUCED AN M-CLASS EVENT, AN M2/1N AT 0358Z.
THIS GROUP CONTINUES TO DECAY AND SIMPLIFY. A REMARKABLE BRIGHT
SURGE WAS OBSERVED ON WEST LIMB AT S12 FROM 0340-0512Z AND WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH AN M1 X-RAY EVENT AND A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP.
ADDITIONAL OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M-CLASS FLARES OCCURRED AT
1043Z AND AT 1102Z. A NEW REGION 6557 ROTATED INTO VIEW AT
S21E70 AS A SIMPLE H-TYPE AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SURGING ON THE
EAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE WITH A CONTINUED CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR
FLARE. REGIONS 6555 AND 6545 ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL
M-CLASS EVENTS, AND REGION 6555 IS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR
A MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED. ACTIVE PERIODS
WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM 2100-2400Z AND FROM 0430-
1200Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS, WITH
OCCASIONAL BRIEF, ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
QUIET TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON THE THIRD DAY.
