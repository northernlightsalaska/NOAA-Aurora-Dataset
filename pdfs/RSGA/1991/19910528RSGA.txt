JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 148 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6654 (N06E54)
SINGLEHANDEDLY CAUSED THE INCREASE, PRODUCING NO FEWER THAN
NINE M-CLASS EVENTS IN THE PAST 24 HOURS. ITS DOCKET INCLUDED
AN: M5/1B AT 1022Z, M3/2B AT 0730Z, M2/1F AT 0534Z, M2/1B AT
1314Z, M1/1N AT 27/2315Z, M1/2F AT 0123Z, M1/1F AT 0337Z,
M1/1B AT 1521Z,AND, MOST RECENTLY, M1/1B AT 1624Z. LIMB PROX-
IMITY INHIBITED EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS, BUT DATA INDICATE A
COMPACT (300 MILLIONTHS) SPOT GROUP THAT IS MAGNETICALLY
COMPLEX. IN FACT, THE TRAILER SPOTS MAY PROVE TO BE A DISTINCT
BIPOLE WHEN THE REGION ROTATES FURTHER INTO VIEW. ELSEWHERE,
REGION 6644 (N21W09) STILL DOMINATES CENTER DISK, BUT HAS
DECAYED SLIGHTLY AND PRODUCED LITTLE. ONE NEW REGION WAS BORN
ON THE DISK, 6656 (N13W11).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6654 SHOULD CONTINUE M-CLASS EVENTS,
ALTHOUGH AT NOT QUITE AS FRENETIC A PACE. REGION 6644 IS ALSO
CAPABLE OF AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT MIDDLE
LATITUDES. PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS OCCURRED AT
HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE
CURRENT DISTURBANCE WEAKENS. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD END
THE PERIOD.
