JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 072 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6545 (S08E38)
GENERATED TWO X-CLASS FLARES; AN X1/2B TENFLARE AT 0808Z, AND
AN X3/2N TENFLARE AT 1548Z. IT MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE
FOR AN M9 FLARE WITH BOTH TYPE II AND IV SWEEPS AT 0305Z, BUT
COMMUNICATIONS DIFFICULTIES PROHIBITED A POSITIVE IDENTIFICA-
TION OF THE FLARE SITE. THE X1/2B EVENT WAS ALSO NOTEWORTHY
IN THE SENSE THAT THE PLAGE WAS FLARE BRIGHT FOR ALMOST 6
HOURS. LIMITED DATA WERE AVAILABLE TODAY BUT THE REGION SEEMS
TO RETAIN A HIGH DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. ELSEWHERE,
REGION 6538 (S23W17) STILL DOMINATES THE CENTER DISK BUT HAS
BEEN QUIET LATELY AND IN SLOW DECAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AT THE HIGH LEVEL. EXPECT MORE X-CLASS FLARES FROM
REGION 6545 DURING THE INTERVAL. ALSO, REGION 6538 MAY
CONTRIBUTE AN M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY ACTIVE THE PAST 24
HOURS. A BRIEF EPISODE OF MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS OCCURRED
AT MID AND HIGH LATITUDES FROM 0000-0300Z. THE CAUSE OF THIS
SHORT-LIVED DISTURBANCE IS NOT WELL ESTABLISHED. THE THULE
NEUTRON MONITOR REGISTERS A SMALL FORBUSH DECREASE WHICH
BEGAN ABOUT 0600Z. AN ENHANCEMENT IN THE GREATER THAN 10
MEV PROTON FLUX COMMENCED AROUND 12/1800Z AND ATTAINED
VALUES JUST UNDER 10 PFU EARLIER TODAY. THIS INCREASE IS
LIKELY DUE TO A CORONAL MASS EJECTION RELATED TO ACTIVITY
IN REGION 6545 RATHER THAN A SPECIFIC H-ALPHA FLARE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS THE MAJORITY
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. TODAY'S MAJOR FLARES ARE LIKELY TO
ELICIT A STRONG GEOMAGNETIC RESPONSE. IN ADDITION, A PROTON
EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV IS VERY POSSIBLE IF A FLARE-
INDUCED SHOCK IMPACTS THE ALREADY ENHANCED PARTICLE FLUXES
NOW SEEN AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT.
