JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 257 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 SEP 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  ONLY A FEW C-CLASS X-RAY
FLARES WERE RECORDED SINCE YESTERDAY.  THE LARGEST WAS A C5/1N
AT 14/1349Z IN REGION 6824 (S20W08).  THIS REGION HAS SOME
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY BUT IS RATHER SMALL IN SUNSPOT AREA AND
UNIMPRESSIVE IN H-ALPHA STRUCTURE.  REGION 6832 (N06E57) ALSO
CONTAINS A SMALL AMOUNT OF COMPLEXITY BUT HAS NOT PRODUCED ANY
SIGNIFICANT FLARES. NEW REGION 6833 (N04W12) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED IN REGIONS 6824 AND 6832.
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES ARE ALSO POSSIBLE IN THESE REGIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT MOST MIDDLE
LATITUDE STATIONS.  MOSTLY ACTIVE TO STORM CONDITIONS WERE
EXPERIENCED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS WITH A GENERAL TREND TOWARD MORE QUIET CONDITIONS.
