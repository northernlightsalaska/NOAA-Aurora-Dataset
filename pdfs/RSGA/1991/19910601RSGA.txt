DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS, A STRONG TYPE II (ESTIMATED SHOCK VELO-
CITY OF 1400 KM/S), AND A STRONG TYPE IV. OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS
NOTED A SPECTACULAR SPRAY WITH MATERIAL VISIBLE OUT TO 0.5
SOLAR RADII. BRIGHT SURGING AND LOOPS WERE ALSO REPORTED FROM
THIS LOCATION. THIS NEW REGION IS STILL NOT VISIBLE BUT HAS
BEEN ASSIGNED SESC REGION NUMBER 6659. REGION 6654 (N08W01)
PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS EVENTS TODAY: AN M1/1B AT 0253Z AND AN
M2/1B AT 0404Z. REGION 6648 (S12W28) NEARLY DOUBLED IN AREA

1150Z. REGION 6652 (S09W09) SHOWED SLIGHT DECAY AND PRODUCED
MINIMAL ACTIVITY. REGION 6644 (N22W61) WAS QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
HIGH. THE MAIN THREAT FOR MAJOR FLARES IS 6659, ALTHOUGH REGION
6654 REMAINS ACTIVE AND COULD PRODUCE AN ISOLATED MAJOR EVENT
AS WELL. M-CLASS EVENTS ARE A POSSIBILITY FROM REGIONS 6652
AND 6648. AN INCREASE IN BACKGROUND FLUX LEVELS IS EXPECTED
AS 6659 ROTATES INTO VIEW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MOSTLY MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. THE MOST INTENSE PART OF
THE DISTURBANCE TODAY WAS FROM ABOUT 0600-1800Z. THE GREATER
THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT ATTAINED A SECONDARY MAXIMUM DURING
THE PERIOD OF 22 PFU AT 0445Z AND APPEARS TO HAVE ENDED AS
OF 01/1840Z, ALTHOUGH LEVELS REMAIN ENHANCED AT THIS WRITING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
