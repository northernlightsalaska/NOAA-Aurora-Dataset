IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. FOUR M-CLASS EVENTS
OCCURRED: AN M1/0F AT 18/2207Z FROM REGION 6504 (S15E23), AN
M1/0F AT 1021Z FROM REGION 6501 (S10W95), AND TWO UNCORRELATED

NEARBY 6509 (S21E56) ARE THE MOST DOMINANT OF THE FIFTEEN
REGIONS ON THE DISK. THE AREA OF BOTH OF THESE REGIONS HAS
DOUBLED IN THE LAST DAY, TO APPROXIMATELY 510 AND 1350
MILLIONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. REGION 6509 IS MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX
AND BRIGHT. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED: 6512 (S08W48) AND
6513 (N12E66).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. CONTINUED M-CLASS EVENTS ARE LIKELY
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. X-CLASS ACTIVITY MAY OCCUR
AS WELL. REGION 6509 IS THE MOST OMINOUS SPOT GROUP,
ALTHOUGH REGION 6504 (S15E23) MAY ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE
ENERGETIC FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS THE NEXT
