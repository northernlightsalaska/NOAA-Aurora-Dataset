SDF NUMBER 179 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. A VERY LONG DURATION
M6 FLARE WAS OBSERVED AT 28/0626UT IN CONCERT WITH A LOOP
PROMINENCE SYSTEM AT N30E90. THIS IS IN THE AREA WHERE OLD
REGION 6659 IS EXPECTED TO APPEAR IN OVER TWO DAYS. A MODERATE
INTENSITY TYPE II WAS ALSO REPORTED LATE IN THIS FLARE. STRONG
CA XV EMISSION IS VISIBLE OVER THIS AREA (NUMBERED AS REGION
6703 EVEN THOUGH NO SPOTS ARE VISIBLE YET).  ANOTHER ERUPTIVE
EVENT WAS OBSERVED IN H-ALPHA NEAR N35E90 AROUND 1500UT WITH
LITTLE X-RAY EMISSION AND A STRONG TYPE II. REGION 6693
(S07W03) GREW RAPIDLY DURING THE PERIOD AND PRODUCED AN M1/1N
AT 28/1048UT WITH MINOR RADIO BURSTS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE AT A
MODERATE TO HIGH LEVEL DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE M6
FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LARGER HAD REGION
6703 NOT BEEN ALMOST 3 DAYS BEHIND THE EAST LIMB.  CLASS M
AND LARGER FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM THIS AREA. REGION 6693
SHOULD PRODUCE SMALL CLASS M FLARES DURING ITS GROWTH PHASE
AND AN ISOLATED CLASS M FLARE IS POSSIBLE FROM REGION 6694.
