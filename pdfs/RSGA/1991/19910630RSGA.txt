JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 181 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 JUN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6693 (S06W32)
PRODUCED AN M5/1N TENFLARE WITH TYPE IV SWEEP AT 0302Z. THE
WHOLE SUN X-RAY FLUX MAY HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED BY AN ERUPTIVE
PROMINENCE NEAR REGION 6703 (N30E75) AT THE SAME TIME. REGION
6699 (N12E34) CONTRIBUTED AN M1/1N WITH TYPE II SWEEP AT 1549Z.
THIS REGION HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE COMPLEX OVER THE
INTERVAL. REGION 6703 IS STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE, BUT CERTAINLY
MUST BE CONSIDERED A POTENT FLARE SITE. REGION 6693 RETAINS ITS
POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL FLARES AS WELL. THREE NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED: 6707 (S12E69), 6708 (N24W03), AND 6709 (N15E66).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6703, NEE 6659, IS A PROVEN M-CLASS
OR HIGHER ACTIVE REGION. RECENT CORONAL DATA - CALCIUM XV -
INDICATE IT STILL HAS STRONG ASSOCIATED MAGNETIC FIELDS.
REGIONS 6693 AND 6699 MAY ALSO GENERATE OCCASIONAL M-CLASS
FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE, MEASURING 33 NANO-
TESLAS AT BOULDER, OCCURRED AT 0116Z. A SATELLITE PROTON
EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV BEGAN AT 0755Z. THIS EVENT IS
THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SPAWNED BY THE LONG-DURATION M6 FLARE
FROM BEHIND EAST LIMB ON 28 JUNE. THE SLOWLY INCREASING FLUX,
TYPICAL FOR EAST LIMB PARENT FLARES, IS NOW NEAR 25 PFU.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE GREATER THAN 10
MEV PROTON EVENT SHOULD PERSIST THROUGHOUT THE INTERVAL.
