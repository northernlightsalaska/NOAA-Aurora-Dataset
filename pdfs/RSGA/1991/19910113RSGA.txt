JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 013 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6447 (S07E35)
ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE FLARE ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED
DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD. THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS A
C9/1N AT 12/2215Z ACCOMPANIED BY MINOR DISCRETE RADIO EMISSIONS.
REGION 6447 QUIETED, IN TERMS OF FLARE ACTIVITY, DURING THE
SECOND HALF OF THE PERIOD AS REGION 6444 (N15E02) BECAME THE
DOMINANT FLARE PRODUCER. ITS LARGEST FLARE WAS A C1/SF AT
13/1736Z. NEITHER OF THESE REGIONS CHANGED MUCH IN SIZE OR
STRUCTURE DURING THE PERIOD. NEW REGIONS 6451 (N14W25), 6452
(S20E41), AND 6453 (S13E31) WERE NUMBERED. REGION 6452 DISPLAYED
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH, BUT WAS ONLY ABLE TO PRODUCE A SINGLE
SUBFLARE EARLY IN THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 6444 AND 6447 MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS.
HOWEVER, AN ISOLATED PERIOD OF ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
OCCURRED NEAR 13/0600Z, POSSIBLY THE RESULT OF CORONAL HOLE
EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS.
