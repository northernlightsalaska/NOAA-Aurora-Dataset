JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 346 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6958 (S18W32)
PRODUCED AN M2/1B FLARE WITH TYPE II SWEEP AT 11/2105Z, AND
LATER, AN M1/1N AT 1708Z. REGION 6966 (S05E38) HAD AN M1/0N AT
0312Z. BOTH REGIONS EXHIBIT A MODERATE DEGREE OF MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY AND HAVE ACTIVE NEUTRAL LINE FILAMENTS. AN UNUSUAL
TENFLARE OF 290 SFU WITH TYPES II AND IV SWEEP WAS RECORDED AT
0955Z. NO OPTICAL FLARE WAS SEEN THEN AND THE X-RAYS REGISTERED
JUST A SLOW-RISING C-CLASS ENHANCEMENT. ABOUT ONE HOUR LATER A
PROTON ENHANCEMENT BEGAN AT GOES (SEE BELOW).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. AN ENHANCEMENT
IN THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUX BEGAN JUST AFTER 1100Z.
THE SPECTRAL PROFILE SUGGESTS A WESTERN HEMISPHERE PARENT
FLARE, PERHAPS BEYOND WEST LIMB. THE PEAK FLUX BARELY
EXCEEDED 1 PFU, AND IS NOW SLOWLY RETURNING TO BACKGROUND.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED. SOME ACTIVE PERIODS MAY
OCCUR IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS WHEN WHAT SEEMS TO BE A SMALL
CORONAL HOLE, VISIBLE IN X-RAYS, ROTATES TO A FAVORABLE SITE.
