JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 352 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 DEC 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  AN M3 X-RAY FLARE
OCCURRED AT 1029Z, WITH NO OPTICAL CORRELATION.  REGIONS
6972 (S09E34) AND 6966 (S05W42) EACH PRODUCED SEVERAL C-CLASS
FLARES.  THREE NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED:  6978 (S21E71),
6979 (N18E41) AND 6980 (S08E69).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGIONS 6972 AND 6966 ARE THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCES OF EVENTS, ALTHOUGH REGION 6961 (N09W81) MAY STILL
PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT FLARE BEFORE IT ROTATES OFF THE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS, WITH PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING AT
HIGH LATITUDES.  A POSITIVE POLARITY CORONAL HOLE IN THE
NORTHERN SOLAR HEMISPHERE IS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF
THE ACTIVITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED EARLY IN THE PERIOD AND MOSTLY ACTIVE
LATER IN THE PERIOD, DUE TO ANOTHER FAVORABLY LOCATED EXTENSION
OF THE NORTHERN CORONAL HOLE.  HIGH LATITUDES MAY EXPERIENCE
SOME PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING DURING THIS TIME.
