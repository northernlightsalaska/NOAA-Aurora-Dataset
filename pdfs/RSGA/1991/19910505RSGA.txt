SDF NUMBER 125 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 MAY 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6615 (S10W02)
CONTINUED TO GROW IN WHITE LIGHT- SUNSPOT AREA DOUBLED- AND TO
TAKE ON A MORE CONTORTED MAGNETIC TOPOLOGY. THIS EVOLUTION
CULMINATED IN THE FIRST M-CLASS EVENT IN A WEEK, AN M1/1N THAT
ATTAINED AN APPARENT MAXIMUM AT 05/2100Z. THE FLARE IS STILL IN
PROGRESS AT THIS WRITING. A DELTA IS APPARENT IN THE SOUTH-
CENTRAL PART OF THE LEADER SPOTS. OTHER ACTIVITY OF NOTE IS THE
RETURN OF OLD REGION 6580 TO THE DISK, NOW ASSIGNED AS REGION
6619 (N28E69). THIS SPOT GROUP YIELDED FOUR M-CLASS FLARES LAST
TIME AND NOW SEEMS TO BE A FEW LARGE SPOTS WITH A SMALL AMOUNT
OF PLAGE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 6615 AND 6619 ARE THE MOST PROBABLE
SITES FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
