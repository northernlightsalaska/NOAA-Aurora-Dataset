JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 091 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 APR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. EVENT LEVEL SURGING
CONTINUED THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD FROM REGION 6555
(S23, L-182) WHICH IS NOW WELL AROUND THE WEST LIMB. A C4
X-RAY EVENT ACCOMPANIED SURGING FROM THIS AREA AT 01/1203Z.
REGIONS 6562 (N14E15) AND 6563 (S10E19) BOTH DISPLAYED MINOR
OVERNIGHT GROWTH IN SPOT AREA WITH SOME COMPLEXITY STILL
NOTABLE IN 6562. ONLY WEAK SUBFLARING WAS OBSERVED FROM THESE
AREAS. REGION 6558 (S15W67) PRODUCED A C5/1F FLARE AT 01/0646Z.
ACTIVE SURGING AND MODEST CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS WERE NOTED ON
THE SOUTHEAST LIMB TODAY, POSSIBLY HAILING THE RETURN OF OLD
REGION 6538 (S23, L-343) WHICH PRODUCED NUMEROUS MAJOR FLARES
DURING ITS LAST ROTATION. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6562 OR 6563 MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES WITH BRIEF MINOR STORMING AT
HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. THE
MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR THIS ACTIVITY WAS THE X2/3B EVENT
OF 29 MARCH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT THE START OF THE
PERIOD DUE TO THE EVENT NOTED IN SECTION IIA ABOVE.
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL THROUGH THE
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD DUE TO EFFECTS FROM A WELL POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE.
