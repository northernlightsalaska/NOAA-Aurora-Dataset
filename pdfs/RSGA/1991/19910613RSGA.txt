IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 61 NANOTESLA OCCURRED AT 13/0652Z
AS MEASURED BY THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER. THE GREATER
THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN AT 04/0820Z AND REACHED
A PEAK FLUX OF 3000 PFU AT 11/1420Z REMAINED IN PROGRESS.
THE ASSOCIATED PEAK POLAR CAP ABSORPTION WAS 16.5 DB (DAY)
AND 4.1 DB (NIGHT) AND OCCURRED AT 11/1420Z. THE POLAR CAP
ABSORPTION EVENT REMAINED IN PROGRESS AS WELL. A FORBUSH
DECREASE WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONGOING GEOMAGNETIC
STORMING. IT REACHED A PEAK DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 18
PERCENT NEAR 13/0700Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS TOMORROW. THE
FIELD IS THEN EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS ON
THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS AS FLARE EFFECTS SUBSIDE. THE PROTON
AND POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.
