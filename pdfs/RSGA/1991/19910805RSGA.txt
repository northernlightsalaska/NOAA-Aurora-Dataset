JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 217 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6757 (N22W38)
PRODUCED AN M1/1N FLARE AT 0530Z. CONTINUED FRAGMENTATION OF
THE REGIONS TRAILING SPOT AREA WAS NOTED. THE REGION REMAINS
COMPLEX MAGNETICALLY HOWEVER, AND WAS THE SOURCE OF NUMEROUS
LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS FLARES. REGION 6749 (S17W68) PRODUCED A C4/SF
FLARE AT 04/2144Z. INTENSE CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS WERE NOTED ON
THE EASTERN LIMB. NEW REGIONS 6768 (S13E73) AND 6769 (N17E50)
WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6757 CONTINUES TO PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT SOURCE
FOR M-CLASS EVENTS. THIS REGION IS ALSO CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. HIGH LATITUDES EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF MAJOR TO
SEVERE STORMING. THE ACTIVITY IS IN RESPONSE TO EFFECTS
FROM A WELL POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE. A SUDDEN IMPULSE
MEASURING 33 NANOTESLAS WAS OBSERVED ON THE GOES 7
MAGNETOMETER AT 05/2047Z. THE MAJOR FLARE OF 3 AUG IS A
POSSIBLE SOURCE FOR THIS ACTIVITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT ACTIVE LEVELS WITH PERIODS OF STORMING
POSSIBLE AT HIGH LATITUDES DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS.
GENERALLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN BY THE END OF
THE PERIOD.
