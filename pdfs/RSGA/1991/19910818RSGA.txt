JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 230 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6788 (S18E37)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS EVENT: AN M1/1F AT 1253Z. THE RE-
GION IS SMALL AND UNIMPRESSIVE, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO SEVERAL
OTHER REGIONS IN THE NEARLY CONTINUOUS BAND OF SPOTS AND PLAGE
AREAS EXTENDING FROM 6784 (S19W08) TO 6791 (N02E55). TODAY'S
ACTIVITY CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF FREQUENT UPPER LEVEL C-CLASS
EVENTS FROM A VARIETY OF REGIONS SUPERPOSED ON AN ENHANCED
BACKGROUND. AMONG THE MORE PROLIFIC REGIONS: 6786 (S10E24), A
REGION THAT CONTINUES TO GROW AND IS SHOWING THE BEGINNINGS OF
A DELTA CONFIGURATION; 6784 (S19W08), WHICH SHOWS A DELTA
FORMED IN THE TRAILER SPOTS; AND 6791 (N12E57) A TIGHTLY
CLUSTERED GROUP SHOWING STEADY GROWTH.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR M-FLARES ARE 6784 DUE TO THE
TRAILER'S MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY, 6786 DUE TO THE DELTA NEAR
REGION CENTER, 6788 BASED ON PERSISTENCE, AND THE STACKED
PAIR OF REGIONS 6781(S18E07)/6782(S10E08) DUE TO POSSIBLE
INTERACTION BETWEEN STRONG PAIRS OF SPOTS. IN ADDITION OLD
REGION 6749 (S18, L-274), WHICH PRODUCED 1 X-CLASS EVENT ON
ITS PREVIOUS DISK TRANSIT, IS DUE TO RETURN ON DAY THREE AND
MAY INCREASE ACTIVITY AT THAT TIME.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD UNTIL 1834Z WHEN A SUDDEN IMPULSE
WAS OBSERVED. SINCE THEN MID-LATITUDES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE AND
HIGH LATITUDES HAVE BEEN AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.
THE SI MEASURED 23 GAMMA IN BOULDER AND MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED
BY ONE OF THE MANY DISAPPEARING FILAMENTS OF THE LAST FEW
DAYS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS AS THE
CURRENT DISTURBANCE CONTINUES. MOSTLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS
WITH OCCASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES ARE EXPECTED
TO FOLLOW AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE THIRD DAY
