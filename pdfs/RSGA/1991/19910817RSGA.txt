JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 229 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6784 (S19E05)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE: AN M1/1N AT 0031Z. THE
REGION PRODUCED ADDITIONAL SUBFLARES AND SHOWED CONTINUED
GROWTH FROM YESTERDAY IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A MAGNETIC BETA-
GAMMA CONFIGURATION. GROWTH AND OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES WERE ALSO
NOTED IN THE 6781/6782/6783 COMPLEX. THE SPOTS OF 6781 AND 6783
HAVE MERGED SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO COM-
BINE THOSE GROUPS INTO A SINGLE REGION 6781 (S17E20) WITH REGION
6782 (S09E22) STACKED ON TOP. REGION 6786 (S10E36) CONTINUES TO
BE THE LARGEST GROUP BUT PRODUCED ONLY SMALL FLARES. TWO AD-
DITIONAL H-TYPE GROUPS ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY FROM THE EAST
EXTENDING A REMARKABLE BAND OF ACTIVE REGIONS FROM THE SOUTH-
CENTER OF THE DISK TO THE EAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE PRINCIPAL THREATS FOR M-CLASS FLARES APPEAR TO BE
REGIONS 6784 AND 6786. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE FROM
6781 OR 6782. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD PERSISTED AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
WITH SOME PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS. THE ACTIVITY AP-
PEARS TO BE A CONTINUATION OF THE RECURRENCE EFFECTS WHICH
STARTED TWO DAYS AGO.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT GENERALLY ACTIVE LEVELS FOR MOST OF THE
FIRST DAY. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY UNSET-
TLED LEVELS FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS.
