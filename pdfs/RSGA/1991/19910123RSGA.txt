JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 023 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6455 (S13W90) WAS
THE DAYS MOST ACTIVE, PRODUCING SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES,
INCLUDING THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE DAY, A C7/1B AT 0136Z.
ADDITIONAL C-CLASS FLARING AND SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED FROM
REGIONS 6462 (S16E44) AND 6466 (S10E52). CONTINUED GROWTH
AND POSSIBLE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO REGIONS SHOULD
PROVIDE THE INGREDIENTS NECESSARY FOR M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION.
TWO NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED TODAY, REGION 6468 AT (S19E05)
AND 6469 AT (S11E67), WHICH MAY BE THE LEADING EDGE OF OLD
REGION 6442 (S11, L-146), BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRONG
CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS THE PAST FEW DAYS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE POSSIBLE INTERACTION BETWEEN REGIONS 6462 AND
6466 SHOULD PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBILITY OF M-CLASS FLARE
PRODUCTION. REGION 6455 IS STILL CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE LIMB
FOR AN ISOLATED M FLARE TO BE OBSERVED. CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS
SUGGEST THAT THE NEW REGION IN THE SOUTHEAST IS HOT AND MAY
HAVE POTENTIAL FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE
POSSIBLE DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF A RECENT DISAPPEARING FILAMENT
AND THE M-CLASS FLARES OBSERVED THE PAST FEW DAYS.
