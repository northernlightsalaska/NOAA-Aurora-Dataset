JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 051 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 FEB 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO AN M1/SF AT
1328Z, TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS EVENT. THE SOURCE, SURPRISINGLY,
WAS REGION 6495 (S03W83), ONE OF THE SIMPLEST GROUPS ON THE
DISK (AREA 20 MILLIONTHS, CLASS BXO). REGION 6509 (S21E44)
NOW DOMINATES THE DISK IN SIZE AT 1320 MILLIONTHS BUT ONLY
PRODUCED A COUPLE FLARES, THE LARGEST A C7/1F AT 2207Z.
REGION 6508 (S13E49) WHICH IS STACKED ON TOP OF 6509 IS
ALSO QUITE IMPRESSIVE LOOKING BUT COULD ONLY PRODUCE A SUB-
FLARE. SURGING AND INTENSE CALCIUM EMISSION WERE OBSERVED
ON THE EAST LIMB TODAY AT S11, INDICATING THE IMMINENT RETURN
OF OLD REGION 6471 WHICH PRODUCED 2 X-CLASS FLARES AND 10
M-CLASS FLARES ON ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE MAIN THREATS FOR ACTIVITY ARE REGIONS 6508 AND
6509. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. A
MARKED UPWARD TREND IN BACKGROUND LEVELS IS EXPECTED AS OLD
REGION 6471 ROTATES INTO VIEW OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
