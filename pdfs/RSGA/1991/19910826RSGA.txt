JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 238 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. FIVE M-CLASS X-RAY BURSTS
WERE OBSERVED, ONLY TWO OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES.
THE FIRST WAS AN M2/2N AT 25/2337Z AND THE SECOND AN M1/SF AT
26/0538Z BOTH OF WHICH WERE PRODUCED IN REGION 6805 (N23E47)
(REGIONS 6805 AND 6810 WERE COMBINED TO FORM 6805). THIS REGION
WAS STABLE IN TERMS OF GROWTH, BUT WAS MODERATELY COMPLEX IN
MAGNETIC ASPECTS. THE REMAINING THREE M1 X-RAY BURSTS OCCURRED
AT 26/0346Z, 26/1016Z, AND 26/1203Z. NONE OF THE FIVE X-RAY
BURSTS WERE IMPRESSIVE IN RADIO OUTPUT. REGION 6781 (S17W99) WAS
QUIET AS IT CROSSED THE WEST LIMB. NEW REGION 6810 (S19E81) WAS
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6805 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
FLARES AND IS ALSO CAPABLE OF MAJOR FLARE PRODUCTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON
ENHANCEMENT THAT BEGAN NEAR 25/1600Z CROSSED EVENT THRESHOLD
AT 26/1740Z AND WAS IN PROGRESS AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE
FLUX WAS 018 PFU AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND RISING SLOWLY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWED
BY TWO DAYS OF ACTIVE LEVELS (WITH PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING
POSSIBLE AT HIGH LATITUDES). THE ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED
IN RESPONSE TO THE X2/2B FLARE THAT OCCURRED ON 25 AUGUST. THE
27 DAY RECURRENT PATTERN ALSO SUPPORTS AN INCREASE TO COMMENCE
ON THE SECOND DAY. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT IS
EXPECTED TO END LATE ON 27 AUGUST.
