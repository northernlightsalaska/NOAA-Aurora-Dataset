JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 062 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6508 (S14W93)
PRODUCED AN M2/SF FLARE AT 03/1322Z WHILE CROSSING THE LIMB.
REGION 6509 (S22W93) ALSO PRODUCED SUBFLARE ACTIVITY AS IT
CROSSED THE LIMB. A LONG DURATION M1 X-RAY EVENT OCCURRED AT
03/1907Z AND MAY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SURGING WHICH WAS
OBSERVED ON THE NORTHEAST LIMB NEAR N17. THIS SURGING IS
PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETURN OF OLD 6487 (N14, L-011,
CLASS/AREA DKI/770 ON 10 FEB) WHICH PRODUCED MODERATE LEVELS OF
ACTIVITY DURING ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT. THREE ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES
WERE OBSERVED. THE FIRST OCCURRED AT 03/0033Z NEAR N43W90. THE
SECOND OCCURRED AT 03/0158Z NEAR S25E90 AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
A TYPE II RADIO SWEEP BURST. THE THIRD AND LARGEST OF THE THREE
OCCURRED AT 03/0220Z NEAR N26E90 AND EXTENDED OUT TO 0.44 RV.
NEW REGIONS 6531 (S23W24) AND 6532 (N14E68) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN M-CLASS FLARE
FROM BEHIND THE SOUTHWEST LIMB WHERE REGIONS 6508 AND 6509
CONTINUE THEIR DEPARTURE. THERE IS ALSO A CHANCE FOR AN M-CLASS
FLARE FROM THE NORTHEAST LIMB AS OLD 6487 ROTATES INTO VIEW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED THE FIRST TWO DAYS AND QUIET TO
UNSETTLED DURING THE FINAL DAY.
