JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 201 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6734 (N07E62) PRO-
DUCED AN X1/2B FLARE AT 0149Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WEAK TO
MODERATE RADIO BURSTS, AND WEAK TYPE II AND TYPE IV RADIO
SWEEPS. THE REGION APPEARS TO HAVE A DELTA CONFIGURATION, BUT
WAS SHOWING FAIRLY STABLE QUIET PLAGE DURING THE LATER PART OF
THE DAY. REGION 6729 (S22W06) PRODUCED ONE 1N FLARE TODAY (DUR-
ING THE DECAY OF THE X-CLASS FLARE) AND SHOWS SIGNS OF DECAY.
THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINDER OF TODAY'S FLARES (ALL C-CLASS)
CAME FROM REGION 6737 (S15E61). THIS GROUP SHOWED FREQUENT
FLUCTUATIONS IN A HIGHLY MIXED MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION, WHICH
INCLUDES A POSSIBLE DELTA CONFIGURATION. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED TODAY: REGION 6739 NEAR N09E90, A MATURE GROUP WITH
ACTIVE PLAGE, AND REGION 6740 NEAR S24E77, A SIMPLE B-TYPE
GROUP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6734 AND 6737 SHOW THE GREATEST PO-
TENTIAL FOR MAJOR FLARES, GIVEN THEIR SIZE, MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY,
AND FLARE HISTORY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD BEGAN THE DAY AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS, FOLLOWED BY A PERIOD OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING AT
0730-1200Z. CONDITIONS WERE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE DAY. NOTE: DUE TO POWER OUTAGE TODAY'S
OBSERVED FREDERICKSBURG A-INDEX WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND WAS
ESTIMATED TO BE 25.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS
AS A RESPONSE TO RECENT SOLAR ACTIVITY INCLUDING POSSIBLE CON-
TRIBUTIONS FROM TODAY'S X-CLASS FLARE. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED
TO SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS BY THE THIRD DAY.
