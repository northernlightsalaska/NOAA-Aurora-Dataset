JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 280 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 OCT 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE LARGEST EVENTS OF THE
DAY WERE A C9/SF FROM REGION 6850 (S12W82) AT 1018Z AND A C8/SN
FROM REGION 6861 (N07W34) AT 1531Z. OTHER ACTIVITY TODAY
INCLUDED A SPRAY FROM NEAR REGION 6850 AROUND 1450Z. MATERIAL
FROM THIS SPRAY WAS SEEN OUT TO .13 SOLAR RADII. NEW REGIONS
6867 (N19W04) AND 6868 (S33W57) WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE 6850/6853 COMPLEX CONTINUES TO PROVIDE
THE GREATEST POSSIBILITY OF MODERATE ACTIVITY. ANALYSIS OF
MAGNETIC DATA FROM REGION 6861 SHOWS INCREASING SHEAR
DEVELOPING IN THE TRAILER PORTION, SUGGESTION THAT ADDITIONAL
M-CLASS ACTIVITY MAY BE FORTHCOMING FROM THIS REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THIS ACTIVITY IS MOST LIKELY
DUE TO THE FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE NOW IN THE
SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS EFFECTS FROM
THE CORONAL HOLE CONTINUE. BY DAY TWO CONDITIONS SHOULD
BECOME MOSTLY UNSETTLED.
