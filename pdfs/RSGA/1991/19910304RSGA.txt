JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 063 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 MAR 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. A LONG DURATION X7 X-RAY
BURST OCCURRED AT 04/1403Z. IT PROBABLY ORIGINATED FROM BEHIND
THE SOUTHEAST LIMB NEAR SE22 WHERE STRONG SURGING AND LOOP
PROMINENCES OCCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF THE EVENT. A STRONG
TYPE II SWEEP AND 5500 SFU TENFLARE WERE ALSO OBSERVED DURING
THE BURST. ALSO, THREE OTHER LONG DURATION M-CLASS X-RAY
BURSTS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM THIS SITE: AN M2 AT
04/0533Z, AN M1 AT 04/1140Z, AND AN M2 AT 04/1934Z WHICH WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT TYPE II SWEEP BURST.  ALL THIS
ACTIVITY PROBABLY PORTENDS THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 6511
(S23, L-346, CLASS/AREA CAO/100 ON 18 FEB) WHICH APPEARED TO BE
IN A GROWTH PHASE AS IT CROSSED THE WEST LIMB ON 19 FEBRUARY.
REGION 6536 (N16E76) PRODUCED AN M2/2F FLARE AT 04/1557Z. REGION
6529 (N08W39) PRODUCED AN M1/1N FLARE AT 04/1750Z. FIVE NEW
REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED: 6533 (S20W71), 6534 (S02W55), 6535
(S17E29), 6536 (N16E76), AND 6537 (S09E80).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE FOR M-CLASS AND A
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR X-CLASS EVENTS FROM THE SOUTHEAST LIMB GIVEN
ITS PRESENT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. REGION 6536 MAY ALSO PRODUCE AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
