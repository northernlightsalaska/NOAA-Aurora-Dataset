JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 252 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 SEP 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  ONE SMALL M FLARE
WAS OBSERVED, AN M2/2B FROM REGION 6818 (S13W78) AT 0608UT.
THIS REGION REMAINS COMPLEX AS IT BEGINS ITS WEST LIMB TRANSIT.
DEVELOPMENT APPEARS TO HAVE SLOWED IN REGION 6823 (N04E03) AND
ONLY SMALL FLARES ARE BEING OBSERVED.  TWO SMALL REGIONS WERE
NUMBERED TODAY, REGION 6825 (N18W76) AND REGION 6826 (N20W10).
SEVERAL REGIONS WHICH PRODUCED M FLARES LAST ROTATION ARE DUE
TO RETURN TO THE EAST LIMB DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT REGION 6818 WILL
PRODUCE ADDITIONAL MAJOR FLARES AS IT TRANSITS THE WEST LIMB.
THE REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTIVE LONGITUDES NOW ROTATING
ONTO THE DISK MAY BE A SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL EVENTS.
