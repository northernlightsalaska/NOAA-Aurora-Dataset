JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 198 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 JUL 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS,
REGION 6729 (S23E34) PRODUCED AN X1/2B PARALLEL RIBBON FLARE
THAT MAXED AT 0637Z.  IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TYPE II AND IV
RADIO SWEEPS AND A BURST INTENSITY OF 600 FLUX UNITS AT
2695 MHZ (A TENFLARE). REGION 6729 CONTINUES TO BE UNIMPRESSIVE
IN H-ALPHA AND WHITE LIGHT, AND HAS LOST THE WEAK DELTA
MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION IT CONTAINED YESTERDAY.  C-CLASS X-RAY
FLARES WERE OBSERVED IN REGION 6728 (S26E12), BUT IT TOO IS
NO LONGER MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. SURGING WAS REPORTED ON BOTH
LIMBS.  SURGING NEAR S06W90 MARKS THE DEPARTURE OF PLAGE
REGION 6724. SURGING NEAR S07E90 MAY SIGNAL THE RETURN
OF OLD REGIONS 6697 AND 6693.  OLD REGION 6693 PRODUCED
SIGNIFICANT FLARES LAST ROTATION.  ACTIVE SURGING AND A
BRIGHT SURGE ON THE LIMB WERE SEEN NEAR S21E90 AT ABOUT
1900Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  REGIONS PRESENTLY ON THE DISK DO NOT EXHIBIT THE
COMPLEXITY EXPECTED FOR SUSTAINED SIGNIFICANT FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS
AT MIDDLE LATITUDES FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR TO MAJOR
STORM LEVELS WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH GEOMAGNETIC LATITUDES.
THIS RECURRENT ACTIVITY IS PRESUMED TO BE DUE TO THE
EARLY ARRIVAL OF EXPECTED CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGHOUT
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE MOST INTENSE ACTIVITY WILL
LIKELY OCCUR ON THE 19TH, WHEN POSSIBLE EFFECTS FROM
TODAY'S X1 FLARE COULD ENHANCE THE CORONAL HOLE
DISTURBANCE ALREADY IN PROGRESS.
