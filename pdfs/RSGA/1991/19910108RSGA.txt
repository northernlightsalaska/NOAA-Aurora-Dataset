JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 008 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 JAN 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6442 (S11W59)
PRODUCED THREE M-CLASS FLARES SINCE YESTERDAY, AN M1/1N AT
08/0434Z, AN M1/SF AT 08/0656Z, AND AN M1/1N AT 08/1127Z. THE
FLARE AT 08/0434Z WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 2695 MHZ RADIO BURST OF
640 SFU.  THIS REGION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP BUT AT A SLOWER RATE
THAN YESTERDAY. ADDITIONAL SPOTS HAVE ROTATED INTO VIEW BEHIND
REGION 6444 (N14E65). THESE SPOTS COULD BE TRAILERS TO 6444
OR A SEPARATE GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH OLD REGION 6412. THIS
QUESTION WILL BE RESOLVED AS THE REGION ROTATES FARTHER ONTO
THE DISK. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE FROM BEYOND THE EAST LIMB
WAS OBSEVED NEAR S16E90 AT 08/1825Z. THIS EPL WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH A LONG DURATION C7 X-RAY BURST, WHICH REACHED A MAXIMUM AT
08/1848Z, AND A STRONG TYPE II SWEEP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. M-CLASS FLARES ARE POSSIBLE IN REGIONS 6442 AND 6444.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.

EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
