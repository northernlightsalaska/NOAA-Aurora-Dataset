JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 270 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 SEP 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE CLUSTER OF ACTIVE
REGIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST CONTINIUE TO DOMINATE PROVIDING THE
SOURCE FOR MOST OF THE DAY'S ACTIVITY. REGION 6848 (S07E27)
CONTINUED TO GROW WITH ADDITIONAL SPOTS FORMING IN THE TRAILING
PORTION OF THE REGION. THESE NEW SPOTS HOWEVER, MAY BE A NEW
REGION EMERGING IN THIS ALREADY COMPLEX AREA. REGION 6850
(S11E44) ALSO DISPLAYED GROWTH WHILE REMAINING THE LARGEST,
MOST COMPLEX AREA ON THE DISK. REGION 6853 (S20E56) GENERATED
MOST OF THE DAY'S FLARE ACTIVITY WITH SEVERAL SUBFLARES, A C8/SF
TENFLARE (210 SFU) AT 0355Z, AND A LONG DURATION C7/SF FLARE
AT 1623Z. TWO SEGMENTS OF FILAMENT, ONE LOCATED NEAR N15E48, THE
OTHER NEAR S20E12, DISAPPEARED DURING THE PERIOD. NO NEW REGIONS
WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE CLUSTER OF REGIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST (6848, 6850,
6853) PROVIDE THE BEST SOURCE FOR ENERGETIC EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO SEVERE
STORM LEVELS. SEVERE STORMING WAS NOTED AT HIGH LATITUDES
BETWEEN 0800-1200Z. THE CURRENT ACTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH
A WELL POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT 24-36 HOURS, THEREAFTER DECREASING TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS.
