JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 241 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 AUG 1991
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THE LARGEST EVENT OF
THE PERIOD, AN M3 X-RAY EVENT, WAS OBSERVED AT 29/0509Z.
SIGNIFICANT SURGING ERUPTED ON THE NORTHWEST LIMB IN CONJUNCTION
WITH THIS ACTIVITY SUGGESTING DEPARTED REGION 6785 (N11, L-358)
AS THE LIKELY SOURCE. SUBFLARING OBSERVED IN REGION 6793 (N16,
L-344) MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FLUX LEVEL ACHIEVED WITH
THIS EVENT. REGION 6805 (N24E14) DISPLAYED MINOR GROWTH WHILE
PRODUCING ISOLATED SUBFLARING. REGIONS 6807 (S08E06) AND 6811
(S19E52) ALSO DISPLAYED GROWTH AND CONTRIBUTED SEVERAL C-CLASS
FLARES EACH. NEW REGION 6812 (N12E23) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6805, 6807, AND 6811 ARE POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR
M-CLASS ACTIVITY. REGION 6805 ALSO POSES A SLIGHT THREAT FOR
MAJOR FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
WITH ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS NOTED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE IN RESPONSE TO EFFECTS FROM A
FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
