JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 037 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 FEB 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH DUE TO A CLASS M9 FLARE
THAT WAS REPORTED AS A COMBINATION 3B FLARE AT (N13 E25) IN
REGION 7417 (N15 E20) AND A 2B FLARE (N09 E25) IN REGION 7419
(N11 E25).  THE FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A RADIO BURST OF 660
FLUX UNITS AT 2695 MHZ BUT WITH NO TYPE II/TYPE IV YET REPORTED.
THE X-RAY EVENT BEGAN ABOUT 06/1820 UT, THE OPTICAL EVENTS AT
06/1813 UT.  AN EARLIER CLASS M1 FLARE (S09 E56) BEGAN AT
06/1643 UT IN REGION 7420 (S07 E51). AN H-ALPHA FILAMENT
BETWEEN 10 AND 15 DEGREES IN HELIOCENTRIC LONGITUDE DISAPPEARED
NEAR N00 E15 OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. AT 06/2100, THE GOES
X-RAY PLOTS ARE MARKED BY A ATTRACTIVE SERIES OF SINUSOIDAL
OSCILLATIONS OF ABOUT 15 MINUTES DURATION EACH AND IN PROGRESS
SINCE THE FLUX REACHED NEAR-BACKGROUND LEVELS AROUND 06/1930 UT.
THE 10.7 CM FLUX VALUE REPORTED BELOW IS PROBABLY FLARE-
ENHANCED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH, WITH CLASS M FLARES LIKELY AND CLASS X FLARES
POSSIBLE. THE FOCUS OF ACTIVITY IS IN THE AREA WHERE REGIONS
7417 AND 7419 MEET AND IN POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS TO REGION
7420.  THE NATURE OF THE ACTIVITY IN REGIONS 7417 AND 7419
INDICATES A CHANCE OF AN ENERGETIC PARTICLE EVENT OCCURRING
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET WITH A CHANCE OF ISOLATED UNSETTLED
PERIODS.  THE VARIOUS TYPES OF ACTIVITY OCCURRING NEAR SOLAR
CENTRAL MERIDIAN MAY BE AN INDICATION OF CHANGES IN THE
LARGE SCALE SOLAR MAGNETIC FIELDS WHICH COULD PRODUCE
EFFECTS IN THE EARTH'S GEOMAGNETIC FIELD BY 09 FEBRUARY.
