TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7435 (N10E26)
PRODUCED AN ISOLATED C-CLASS SUBFLARE WHILE DISPLAYING SLIGHT
GROWTH. AN ACTIVE SURGE REGION WAS OBSERVED NEAR N13E90 AT
28/1804Z, PROBABLY INDICATING THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 7417.
NEW REGIONS 7437 (S23W34) AND 7438 (N23E46) WERE NUMBERED.

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 12 NANOTESLA WAS
OBSERVED BY THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER AT 27/2220Z. THE
IMPULSE WAS FOLLOWED BY MOSTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS. ACTIVITY
BEGAN TO SUBSIDE NEAR 28/1800Z. HIGH LATITUDES REACHED ACTIVE
TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOLLOWING THE IMPULSE. THIS ACTIVITY
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY EITHER CORONAL HOLE OR DISAPPEARING
FILAMENT EFFECTS, OR PERHAPS A COMBINATION THEREOF.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS DUE TO THE
CONTINUING EFFECTS OF FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCES. INTERMITTENT
STORM CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO MOSTLY
UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE FINAL DAY.
