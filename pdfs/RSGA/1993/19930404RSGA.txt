JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 094 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 APR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. THE SIX SPOTTED
REGIONS ON THE DISK ARE VERY ORDINARY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW TO LOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET UP TO A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 11
NANOTESLA (AT BOULDER) AT 1434Z. THE FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR
TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS AT ALL LATITUDES SINCE. THE GOES
SPACECRAFT HAVE EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSINGS
DURING THIS DISTURBANCE, THE MOST LENGTHY ABOUT TWO HOURS,
ENDING AT 1800Z. THE EQUATORWARD LOBE OF THE SOUTHERN POLAR
CROWN CORONAL HOLE, NOW POSITIONED NEAR S30W25, IS THOUGHT
TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE HIGH SPEED STREAM NOW BUFFETING THE
MAGNETOSPHERE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS.
THE POSSIBILITY OF EPISODES OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS
DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIMES IS GOOD. THIS DISTURBANCE SHOULD ABATE
BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.
