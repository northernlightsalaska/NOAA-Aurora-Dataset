HAS PRODUCED 1 C4 FLARE, BUT HAS EXHIBITED A SLIGHT INCREASE
IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD COMPLEXITY. REGION 7669 (S10W12) HAS
PRODUCED 5 C CLASS FLARES WITH THE LARGEST A C4. THIS REGION'S
STRUCTURE IS BECOMING MAGNETICALLY MORE COMPLEX AND EXHIBITING
GROWTH. THE BACKGROUND X-RAY FLUX HAS GRADUALLY INCREASED.
