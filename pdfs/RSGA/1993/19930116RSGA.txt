JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 016 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 JAN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7400 (S09W57) GREW
SLIGHTLY AS IT PRODUCED A FEW IMPULSIVE C-CLASS FLARES. PROBABLY
THE MOST NOTEWORTHY ACTIVITY WAS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF TWO HIGH
LATITUDE FILAMENTS FROM THE SOUTH-CENTER DISK EARLY IN THE
PERIOD. EACH SPANNED MORE THAN 20 DEGREES. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED, 7404 (N13W39) AND 7405 (S12E27).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THE POTENTIAL FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE INCREASES IF
REGION 7400 CONTINUES TO DEVELOP.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO MILDLY UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
