JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 127 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 MAY 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN A SERIES OF CLASS C FLARES.  MOST OF
THEM HAVE BEEN IN REGION 7500 (N17E39) WITH OCCASIONAL
SMALLER FLARES IN REGION 7496 (N15E22) AS WELL. REGION
7500 CONTINUES TO BE THE MAIN AREA OF INTEREST.  A SMALL
FILAMENT HAS DISAPPEARED NEAR THE CENTER OF THE DISK,
NEAR THE NEWER REGIONS 7501 (S10W03) AND 7499 (S08W11),
SIGNALLING SOME POSSIBLE LARGE SCALE REARRANGEMENT OF
MAGNETIC STRUCTURES IN THAT AREA.  A NEGATIVE POLARITY
CORONAL HOLE WITH CONSISTENT DEFINITION AND SIZE
IS NOW LOCATED AROUND NO5 TO S20 AND W20 TO W40.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE WITH AN INCREASING CHANCE OF CLASS M FLARES
FROM THE COMPLEX OF REGIONS 7496 AND 7500.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE DUE TO THE NEGATIVE
POLARITY CORONAL HOLE WEST OF CENTRAL MERIDIAN.
