JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 159 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. AN M1 X-RAY BURST
OCCURRED AT 08/0215Z ASSOCIATED WITH A 120 SFU TENFLARE, BUT NO
OPTICAL CORRELATION. HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THAT REGION 7518
(S10W49) WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BURST, GIVEN ITS RECENT LEVEL
OF ACTIVITY. IT PRODUCED NUMEROUS SUBFLARES DURING THE PERIOD
INCLUDING THREE THAT REACHED C-CLASS. THE OTHER REGIONS WERE
QUIET AND STABLE. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THERE IS A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN M-CLASS FLARE
FROM REGION 7518. THE REGION ALSO PRESENTS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A FEW BRIEF PERIODS OF ACTIVE LEVELS
OCCURRED BEFORE 08/1500Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS UNTIL LATE 9 JUNE OR
EARLY 10 JUNE WHEN THE EFFECTS FROM YESTERDAY'S M5/2B FLARE
ARE PREDICTED TO ARRIVE. THE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE SECOND DAY WITH BRIEF PERIODS
OF MAJOR STORMING POSSIBLE. THE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE
TO UNSETTLED LEVELS DURING THE THIRD DAY.
