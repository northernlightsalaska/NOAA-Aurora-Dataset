JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 171 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7524 (N10E51)
PRODUCED A C5/1N AT 19/2348Z WITH A MODERATE INTENSITY TYPE II.
THIS REGION IS NOW WITHOUT VISIBLE SPOTS. A VERY LONG DURATION
B9 X-RAY ENHANCEMENT OCCURRED BETWEEN 20/1455-1941Z. A LONG
LIVED TYPE IV ACCOMPANIED THIS EVENT. NO DISK REGIONS WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ENHANCEMENT. HOWEVER, SURGING WAS VISIBLE
AT NE14 COINCIDENT IN TIME. NO X-RAY IMAGERY WAS AVAILABLE TO
VERIFY THE CORRELATION. REGION 7525 (S17W22) EMERGED RAPIDLY
AND PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES. REGION 7526 (N13W24) EMERGED
AT A LESSER RATE AND WAS VOID OF BURST ACTIVITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A LOW LEVEL WITH C-CLASS FLARES BECOMING MORE FREQUENT. NEW
REGION 7525 SHOULD PRODUCE MOST OF THESE EVENTS SHOULD GROWTH
CONTINUE. THE LONG DURATION B9 ENHANCEMENT WITH TYPE IV WAS
POSSIBLY FROM A LARGER FLARE BEYOND THE LIMB. IT REMAINS
POSSIBLE THAT AN M-CLASS FLARE COULD ORIGINATE FROM A REGION
JUST BEYOND THE EAST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET. A BRIEF PERIOD
OF UNSETTLED CONDITIONS WAS EXPERIENCED BETWEEN 20/0600-
0900Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR 21-22 JUN. UNSETTLED TO
SLIGHTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED ON 23 JUN
AS A CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE BEGINS.
