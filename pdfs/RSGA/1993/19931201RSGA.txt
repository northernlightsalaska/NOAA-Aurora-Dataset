JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 335 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 DEC 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7624 (N04W28) WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE C-CLASS FLARES INCLUDING THE LARGEST OF
THE PERIOD, A C5/1N AT 01/0419UT. THIS REGION GREW RAPIDLY AND
ALSO PRODUCED A NUMBER OF B-CLASS AND SUBFAINT FLARES THROUGH
THE PERIOD. REGION 7627 (S07E57) IS ALSO GROWING AT A GOOD PACE
AND PRODUCED A SINGLE C3/SF FLARE AT 01/0705UT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7624 AND 7627 BOTH HAVE GOOD POTENTIAL FOR C-CLASS
FLARING AND AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF PRODUCING AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. HIGH LATITUDE
STATIONS SAW MINOR TO SEVERE STORMING DURING THE LAST HALF
OF THE PERIOD. THE ACTIVITY IS MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF A
WELL POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND
MINOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE NEXT 24
HOURS. ACTIVITY IS THEN EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO
ACTIVE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
