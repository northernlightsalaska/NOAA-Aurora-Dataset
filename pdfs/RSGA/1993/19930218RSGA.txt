JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 049 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 FEB 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7425 (N16W14)
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE DAY WITH AN M4/2B
TENFLARE AT 18/0308UT. THIS FLARE HAD ASSOCIATED TYPE II AND
TYPE IV RADIO SWEEPS AND A LOOP PROMINENCE ON THE DISK. THIS
REGION ALSO PRODUCED A 1N FLARE WITH A TYPE II SWEEP AT 18/1135
UT, A C1/1F FLARE AT 18/1752UT AND A B8/SF FLARE AT 18/0800UT.
REGION 7427 (S19E17) JOINED IN WITH AN M1/1N TENFLARE WITH AN
ASSOCIATED TYPE IV SWEEP AT 18/1003UT, AN M1/1B TENFLARE WITH
AN ASSOCIATED TYPE II SWEEP AT 18/1106UT, A C1/SF FLARE AT
18/1809UT AND A SMALL SF FLARE. REGION 7424 (N10W44) PRODUCED
A SMALL C1/SF FLARE AT 18/1335UT AND A SF FLARE AT 18/1254UT.
REGIONS 7430 (N08E25), 7431 (S12E55) AND 7432 (S17E73) WERE
NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 7425 AND 7427 HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR
M-CLASS FLARES. REGION 7427 HAS A SMALL CHANCE OF PRODUCING AN
ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS SAW A SHORT
PERIOD OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FROM 18/1200 TO 1500UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, THEN
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD AS SHOCK FRONTS FROM TODAYS FLARE ACTIVITY REACH
THE GEOMAGNETOSPHERE. A GOOD SIZED CORONAL HOLE WILL ROTATE
INTO A FAVORABLE POSITION BY THE THIRD DAY OF THE PERIOD.
