JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 328 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 NOV 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW DUE TO A C1 FLARE FROM
REGION 7618 (N06W85) AT 1854UT. REGION 7620 (N05W10) NEARLY
DOUBLED IN SIZE DURING THE PERIOD AND PRODUCED FREQUENT B-CLASS
FLARES. SOME MIXED POLARITIES ARE VISIBLE IN THE REGION AS IS
AN ARCH FILAMENT SYSTEM WHICH BODES WELL FOR FURTHER GROWTH.
REGION 7622 (N13E36) WAS STABLE WITH INFREQUENT FLUCTUATIONS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE LOW
WITH REGION 7622 PRODUCING THE BULK OF THE C-CLASS FLARES.
CONTINUED GROWTH IN 7620 WILL MAKE M-CLASS FLARES MORE
LIKELY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD REMAINED QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR 24 NOV. QUIET TO UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED ON 25 AND 26 NOV.
