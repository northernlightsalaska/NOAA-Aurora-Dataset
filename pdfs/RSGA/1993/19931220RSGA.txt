JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 354 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 DEC 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. NEW REGION 7640 (N09E70)
PRODUCED SEVERAL SMALL C-CLASS FLARES AND NUMEROUS LESSER
FLUCTUATIONS. THIS REGION IS NEW FROM LAST ROTATION AND APPEARS
TO BE IN A GROWTH PHASE. THE SPOTS HERE ARE NOT IN A STANDARD
BIPOLAR CONFIGURATION. REGION 7641 (N03E75) ALSO APPEARED BUT
WAS QUIET. THIS IS THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 7624 WHICH SEEMS
TO HAVE SLOWLY DECAYED DURING ITS INVISIBLE HEMISPHERE TRANSIT.
OTHER REGIONS WERE STABLE AND QUIET. RECENT YOHKOH IMAGES DO
NOT SHOW THE LARGE CORONAL HOLE IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT
THAT HAS BEEN PERSISTENT FOR MANY ROTATIONS. IT MAY BECOME
VISIBLE AS THOSE LONGITUDES APPROACH CENTRAL MERIDIAN.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A GENERALLY LOW LEVEL. REGION 7640 IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES. ONCE THE MAGNETIC STRUCTURE CAN BE
OBSERVED, THIS FORECAST MAY INCREASE. AT THIS TIME, REGION
7640 DOES NOT APPEAR CAPABLE OF GENERATING A MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS.
ISOLATED ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE EXPERIENCED AT VARIOUS SITES
AT VARIOUS TIMES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE FIELD SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED ON 21 DEC. QUIET CONDITIONS ARE
FORECAST FOR 22-23 DEC.
