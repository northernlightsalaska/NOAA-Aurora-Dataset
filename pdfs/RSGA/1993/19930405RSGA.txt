JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 095 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 APR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S LARGEST EVENT WAS
A C4 AT 1648Z (THE ONLY C-CLASS EVENT OF THE DAY) WHICH WAS
CORRELATED WITH SOME ACTIVITY ON EAST LIMB AT ABOUT N23. THERE
APPEARS TO BE A NEW REGION ROTATING INTO VIEW AT THAT LOCATION.
THE REMAINDER OF TODAY'S ACTIVITY WAS VERY LIMITED. ALL OF THE
REGIONS ON THE DISK WERE BASICALLY STABLE AND QUIET. REGION
7469 (S10E15) SHOWED SOME GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A MAGNETIC
GAMMA CONFIGURATION IN THE TRAILING SPOTS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR C-FLARES ARE REGION
7469 AND THE NEW REGION ON EAST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MINOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS.
YESTERDAY'S STORM DEVELOPED INTO A MAJOR STORM AT MID-LAT-
ITUDES AND MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM AT HIGH LATITUDES. A BRIEF
3 HOUR PERIOD OF SEVERE STORM WAS OBSERVED AT MID-LATITUDES
FROM 0300-0600Z. THIS DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY
A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE, BUT ITS MORPHOLOGY
AND SEVERITY RAISE DOUBTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
12 HOURS AS NIGHTTIME SUBSTORMS ARE LIKELY. CONDITIONS SHOULD
SUBSIDE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AS THE DISTURBANCE ENDS.
