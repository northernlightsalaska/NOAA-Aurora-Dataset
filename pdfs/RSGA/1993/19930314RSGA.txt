JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 073 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY TWO LOW LEVEL C-CLASS
FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD. REGIONS 7440 (S06W80) AND
7448 (N16E27) PRODUCED ALL OF TODAY'S SCANT ACTIVITY. BOTH
GROUPS APPEARED TO BE IN SLOW DECLINE, ALTHOUGH THE LIMB PROX-
IMITY OF 7440 MADE MEASUREMENTS DIFFICULT. SOME SMALL, NEW FLUX
REGIONS APPEARED TO BE FORMING ON THE DISK TOWARD THE END OF THE
DAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT FROM EITHER OF REGION 7440
OR 7448 IS STILL CONSIDERED A POSSIBILITY AS BOTH REGIONS RE-
TAIN MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AND STRENGTH. A DOWNWARD TREND IN
ACTIVITY LEVELS IS EXPECTED DUE TO THE DEPARTURE OF REGION
7440.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE DURING
THE PAST 24 HOURS. SOME BRIEF MINOR STORM PERIODS OCCURRED AT
HIGH LATITUDES. THERE WAS NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE FOR ARRIVAL
OF A SHOCK OR AN INCREASE IN GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY LEVELS DUE
TO THE LONG DURATION M7 FLARE OF 12 MARCH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 24
HOURS AS EFFECTS FROM THE 12 MARCH LDE ARE STILL POSSIBLE. A
GRADUAL DECLINE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE IS EXPECTED BY DAY TWO
AND A RETURN TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED LEVELS IS EXPECTED BY DAY
THREE.
