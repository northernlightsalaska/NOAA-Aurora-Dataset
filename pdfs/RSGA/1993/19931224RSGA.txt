JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 358 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 DEC 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  REGION 7640 (N08E21)
PRODUCED TWO M1/1N FLARES MAXING AT 1507Z AND 1815Z.  NO RADIO
ACTIVITY WAS REPORTED WITH THESE TWO FLARES.  NUMEROUS C-CLASS
FLARING HAS ALSO OCCURRED IN THIS REGION OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.
WHITE LIGHT OBSERVATIONS INDICATE 7640 HAS NEARLY DOUBLED IN
SPOT NUMBER AND HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN AREA WITH RAPID
PENUMBRA DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE REGION.  TWO NEW REGIONS
WERE NUMBERED OVERNIGHT -- RGN 7642 (N10W20) AND RGN 7643
(S16E69).  ALL OTHER REGIONS WERE STABLE.  ONE OTHER ITEM OF
NOTE TO PASS ON:  JUST MINUTES AGO, SANTA CLAUS WAS POSITIVELY
IDENTIFIED ON RADAR LEAVING THE POLAR CAP AND PASSING THROUGH
THE AURORAL OVAL.  ANY MINOR DISTURBANCES IN IONOSPHERIC SIGNA-
TURES SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THIS SEASONAL PHENOMENON.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT IN REGION 7640 SHOULD PRODUCE
MORE M-CLASS ACTIVITY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF X-CLASS ACTIVITY.
