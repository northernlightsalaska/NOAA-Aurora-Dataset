JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 274 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 OCT 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. MOST OF TODAY'S C-LEVEL
FLARE ACTIVITY CAME FROM REGION 7590 (N13E22) INCLUDING A C1/SF
AT 30/2244Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP.
THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE OF DECAY IN THE TRAILER PART OF THE
GROUP AND THE DELTA APPEARED TO BE NEARLY GONE BY DAY'S END:
THE PLAGE HAS COOLED OFF IN THIS PART OF THE GROUP. ON THE OTHER
HAND SOME NEW POSITIVE POLARITY SPOTS BEGAN TO EMERGE IN A CIR-
CULAR ARC IN FRONT OF AND ABOVE THE LARGE NEGATIVE POLARITY
LEADER OF THE GROUP. SHEAR ANALYSIS SHOWS SOME SIGNIFICANT MAG-
NETIC SHEAR JUST TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE LEADER. REGION 7592
(S13E66) HAS ROTATED MORE CLEARLY INTO VIEW AS A BRIGHT (BUT
SMALL) C-TYPE GROUP WHICH ALSO CONTRIBUTED A COUPLE OF C-CLASS
FLARES DURING THE PERIOD. A WEAK TYPE II SWEEP WAS REPORTED TO
HAVE OCCURRED AT 01/2034Z AND MAY HAVE BEEN RELATED TO A SUB-
FLARE OUT OF REGION 7590 WHICH WAS IN PROGRESS AT THAT TIME.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7590 STILL SHOWS GOOD POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING
MODERATE SIZED FLARES. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A MAJOR
FLARE AS WELL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FROM
THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD THROUGH ABOUT 1500Z, WITH SOME
REPORTS OF ISOLATED MAJOR STORMING AT HIGH LATITUDES. CON-
DITIONS HAVE CALMED DOWN TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED SINCE THEN.
THE DISTURBANCE FITS IN WITH A RECURRENCE PATTERN IN THE
GEOMAGNETIC RECORD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS AS
A RESULT OF LOCAL MIDNIGHT SUBSTORM ACTIVITY. CONDITIONS
SHOULD RETURN TO PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED THEREAFTER AND FOR
THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
