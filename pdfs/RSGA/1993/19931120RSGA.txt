IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  REGION 7618 (N07W31)
REMAINS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE AREA ON THE DISK.  IN WHITE LIGHT,
THE REGION HAS DECREASED IN AREA AND SPOT NUMBER, BUT STILL
RETAINS ITS BETA-DELTA CONFIGURATION.  NEW REGION 7621 (S09E48)
WAS NUMBERED OVERNIGHT.  AN AREA OF INTEREST TO WATCH IS ON THE

LOW TO MODERATE WITH REGION 7618 THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE TO
PRODUCE C AND M-CLASS ACTIVITY.  A NEW, ACTIVE REGION MAY ROTATE
INTO VIEW OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO
