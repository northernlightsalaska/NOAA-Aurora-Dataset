JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 048 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 FEB 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 7420 (S07W90) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE, AN M5/SF AT 1040Z. THE REGION
WAS NEAR THE LIMB AND THIS ALLOWED DETAILED OBSERVATIONS OF
LOOP AND SURGE DYNAMICS DURING THE FLARE EVENT. THE OTHER
GROUPS ON THE DISK WERE RELATIVELY CALM. REGION 7427 (S21E31)
CONTINUES TO SHOW FREQUENT SMALL FLARES. REGION 7425 (N15W01)
CONTINUES TO GROW AND PRODUCED A COUPLE OF SMALL FLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR M-CLASS FLARES ARE
REGIONS 7420 (FROM BEHIND THE LIMB FOR ONE DAY) AND 7425.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS.
AN INITIALLY QUIET FIELD BECAME DISTURBED FOLLOWING A SUDDEN
IMPULSE AT 0302Z ON THE 17TH. MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
ENSUED AT MID-LATITUDES AND SEVERE STORM LEVELS WERE ATTAINED
AT HIGH LATITUDES BETWEEN 0900-1800Z. CONDITIONS APPEARED TO
BE SUBSIDING TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE SOURCE OF THE
DISTURBANCE IS UNCERTAIN BUT MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE FILAMENT
THAT ERUPTED FROM THE DISK LATE ON THE 13TH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
12 HOURS AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE MAY CAUSE SOME NIGHTTIME
SUBSTORMS. CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FIRST DAY. THERE IS A CHANCE FOR AN
INCREASE TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE SECOND DAY AS A
RESPONSE TO TODAY'S MAJOR EVENT. MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS
SHOULD DOMINATE BY DAY THREE.
