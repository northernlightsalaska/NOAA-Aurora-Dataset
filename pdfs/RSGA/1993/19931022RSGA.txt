TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW DURING THE PAST 24
HOURS. NEW REGION 7607 (S04E22) EMERGED ON THE DISK AS A SIMPLE
BIPOLAR GROUP. X-RAY IMAGES INDICATE A BRIGHTENING ON THE NORTH
EAST LIMB WHICH MAY BE THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 7590, A PRODUCER

VERY LOW BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF REGIONS PRESENTLY VISIBLE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HOWEVER, ISOLATED PERIODS AT
ACTIVE LEVELS WERE REPORTED AT SOME OBSERVATORIES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT UNSETTLED TO OCCASIONALLY ACTIVE LEVELS
INCREASING TOWARD GENERALLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD BASED ON A CORONAL DISTURBANCE SEEN IN X-RAY
