JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 278 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 OCT 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGIONS 7590 (N11W29) AND
7592 (S14E14) PRODUCED SMALL C-CLASS BURSTS. REGION 7590
DECAYED SLIGHTLY IN AREA AND SPOT NUMBER. MAGNETIC GRADIENTS
IN REGION 7592 INCREASED. A TENUOUS FILAMENT LOCATED NEAR
S31W31 FADED BETWEEN 05/1000-1401Z. RECENT YOHKOH IMAGERY
SHOWS A MODERATELY LARGE CORONAL HOLE NEAR CENTRAL MERIDIAN
THAT EXTENDS FROM THE NORTH POLE TO SLIGHTLY PAST THE EQUATOR.
THIS HOLE IS WIDER (MOSTLY TO THE EAST) AND LESS SINUOUS THAN
LAST ROTATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANTLY LOW. REGIONS 7590 AND 7592 ARE CAPABLE OF
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES. A MAJOR FLARE FROM EITHER REGION
REMAINS A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET FOR THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. A CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO
BEGIN LATE ON 09 OCT. DUE TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE HOLE
MENTIONED ABOVE, THE DISTURBANCE THIS ROTATION SHOULD BE
AS SEVERE AS LAST ROTATION, PEAK ABOUT ONE DAY LATER, AND
LAST APPROXIMATELY ONE DAY LONGER.
