SDF NUMBER 365 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 DEC 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. INTERMITTENT C-CLASS
ACTIVITY WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY, WITH THE BRUNT OF THE FLARES
ORIGINATING IN OR NEAR THE REGION 7640 (N08W80) COMPLEX.
REPORTS CHARACTERIZE THIS AREA AS BEING LARGELY STABLE. REGION
7645 (N11E43) IN THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE HAD ONLY A FEW
SMALL FLARES, BUT REMAINS COMPLEX MAGNETICALLY. ONE NEW REGION
WAS BORN ON THE DISK, 7647 (S15E34).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 7640 AND 7645 HOLD THE BEST PROMISE
OF AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET EARLY IN THE PERIOD, THEN
EXPERIENCED MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS AT THE MIDWAY
POINT. THIS DISTURBANCE, THOUGHT TO BE RELATED TO A WESTERN
HEMISPHERE CORONAL HOLE, NOW SEEMS TO BE WEAKENING.
