JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 162 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7518 (S11W85) WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST THREE CLASS-C FLARES OVER THE PAST 24
HOURS. THE LARGEST WAS A C5/SF AT 11/1023UT. FOUR OTHER CLASS-C
X-RAY BURSTS WERE OBSERVED BUT UNCORRELATED. THESE WERE PROBABLY
FROM REGION 7518 AS WELL. THIS REGION IS ABOUT TO ROTATE OFF THE
DISK AND WILL LEAVE US WITH VERY LITTLE OF INTEREST REMAINING.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW UNTIL REGION 7518 COMPLETES ITS TRANSIT, THEN VERY LOW
ACTIVITY WILL PREVAIL. REGION 7518 STILL HAS A CHANCE OF
CLASS-C AND CLASS-M FLARE ACTIVITY AND A SLIGHT POSSIBILTY
OF MAJOR FLARE BEFORE IT IS COMPLETELY AROUND THE LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. WE DETECTED A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 10 NT
LATE YESTERDAY. THE ENSUING ACTIVITY REACHED MINOR TO MAJOR
STORM LEVELS BEFORE SUBSIDING TO MOSTLY QUIET ABOUT 11/0300UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR ENTIRE FORECAST PERIOD.
