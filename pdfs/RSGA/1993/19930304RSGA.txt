JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 063 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7435 (N10W28)
PRODUCED AN M1/1N FLARE AT 04/1020UT, A C1/SF AT 03/2314UT, A
C6/1N AT 04/0119UT AND A C1/SF AT 04/1519UT. THIS REGION HAS
SHOWN SLIGHT DECAY OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. REGION 7440 (S06E53),
A SLOWLY GROWING DKC WITH A BETA-DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION,
PRODUCED ONLY TWO SUBFAINT FLARES. REGION 7434 (S11W64), A
DECAYING HAX SPOT GROUP, PRODUCED A LONG DURATION C8/2N PROTON
FLARE WITH AN ASSOCIATED TYPE IV SWEEP AT 04/1240UT. A PROTON
EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10MEV BEGAN AT 04/1505UT AND WAS HOVERING
AT EVENT LEVELS AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 7435 STILL HAS A FAIR CLASS M FLARE
POTENTIAL AND AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED CLASS X FLARE.
REGION 7440 HOLDS THE BEST CLASS M FLARE POTENTIAL. THE YOHKOH
X-RAY IMAGE SHOWS THIS REGION IS GROWING IN COMPLEXITY AND HOLDS
A FAIR CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED CLASS X FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ALL LATITUDES SAW AN ISOLATED MAJOR
STORM PERIOD AT 04/0300UT WITH NO APPARENT CAUSE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE FIRST DAY OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS ARE EXPECTED
THEREAFTER, A RESULT OF THE PAST FEW DAY'S FLARE AND FILAMENT
ACTIVITY COUPLED WITH A CORONAL HOLE THAT WILL BE NEARING A
FAVORABLE POSITION TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD.
