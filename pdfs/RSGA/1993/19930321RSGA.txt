JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 080 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7448 (N18W59)
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF FLARE ACTIVITY. IT PRODUCED
AN M2/1N FLARE AT 21/0340Z ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT TYPE IV
SPECTRAL RADIO BURST AND A 140 SFU TENFLARE. THIS REGION MAY BE
SHOWING SIGNS OF SLOW DECAY IN THE FORM OF OVERALL PENUMBRAL
FRAGMENTATION, BUT THIS WAS DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN DUE TO WEST
LIMB PROXIMITY. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE REACHING 0.44 SOLAR RADII
WAS OBSERVED NEAR N07W90 AT 21/1110Z. NEW REGIONS 7455 (N19W37)
AND 7456 (N05E21) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW. REGIONS 7448 AND 7452 ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
C-CLASS SUBFLARES. REGION 7448 COULD ALSO PRODUCE AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING WAS OBSERVED AT
SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS FROM 21/1200-1800Z. THE ACTIVE TO
STORM LEVELS WERE PROBABLY DUE TO A WELL PLACED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS ON THE FIRST
DAY DUE TO CONTINUING CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS. QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
