JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 336 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 DEC 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW.  REGION 7624 (N04W42)
AND REGION 7627 (S18E43) REMAIN AS THE TWO MOST IMPRESSIVE
REGIONS ON THE DISK.  REGION 7627 WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ONLY
OPTICALLY CORRELATED FLARE, A WEAK B6/SF.  BOTH REGIONS GREW
SLIGHTLY OVERNIGHT BUT BASICALLY REMAIN SIMPLE BETA GROUPS.
REGION 7628 ROTATED OFF THE DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  BOTH REGIONS 7624 AND 7627 HAVE GOOD POTENTIAL FOR
PRODUCING C-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY AND AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF
PRODUCING ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MID LATITUDES AND UNSETTLED
TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES.  SINCE 12Z, MID
LATITUDE ACTIVITY HAS DECLINED TO ACTIVE LEVELS.  ACTIVITY IS
MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL
HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
DAYS ONE AND TWO AND MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS ON DAY THREE.
