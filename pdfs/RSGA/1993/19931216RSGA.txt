JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 350 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 DEC 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED VERY LOW. NEW REGION 7637
(N08W05) EMERGED RAPIDLY AND IS NOW A SMALL D-CLASS GROUP.
A STRONG ARCH FILAMENT SYSTEM IS VISIBLE THERE. REGION 7635
(N03E51) REMAINED STABLE. A RECENT MAGNETOGRAM SHOWS MIXED
POLARITIES IN THE PLAGE FIELD OF THIS REGION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE VERY
LOW. IF GROWTH CONTINUES IN REGION 7637, SMALL C-CLASS
BURSTS SHOULD BEGIN TO OCCUR.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 0500Z WHEN
A CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE BEGAN. MID-LATITUDES WERE
PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE AFTER THAT TIME. PLANETARY INDICES WERE
ALSO IN THE ACTIVE CATEGORY BUT SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS
EXPERIENCED MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS IN THE LATTER HALF
OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED ON 17 DEC WITH ACTIVE
CONDITIONS PROBABLE DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME. MOSTLY
UNSETTLED LEVELS ARE FORECAST FOR 18 DEC. ACTIVE CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN ON 20 DEC AS A RESULT OF THE FILAMENT
DISRUPTION NOTED YESTERDAY. THE TIMING AND SEVERITY OF
FILAMENT RELATED DISTURBANCES ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.
