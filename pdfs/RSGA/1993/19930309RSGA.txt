JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 068 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7440 (S06W14)
CONTINUED TO PRODUCE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FLARES, WHILE STILL
REMAINING LARGE AND MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. DECAY HAS OCCURRED
IN THE LEADER SPOTS OF THE REGION, BUT A DELTA PERSISTS IN THE
TRAILER. LITTLE ELSE OF INTEREST WAS REPORTED TODAY, AS
BACKGROUND X-RAY FLUXES DROPPED TO WELL BELOW C-LEVEL.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7440, VERY QUIET SINCE ITS MAJOR FLARE LATE
ON MARCH 6, MAY PRODUCE ANOTHER IF AN INSTABILITY DEVELOPS
WITHIN THE REGION. NONE OF THE REMAINING FOUR SPOTTED REGIONS
SEEMS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING BEYOND AN OCCASIONAL SUBFLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS
AT ALL LATITUDES. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 50 NANOTESLA WAS OBSERVED
AT BOULDER AT 08/2139Z. CONDITIONS QUICKLY DETERIORATED WITH
THE MOST INTENSE DISTURBANCE OCCURRING IN THE 12-15 HOURS AFTER
THE PASSAGE OF THE SHOCK. THIS ACTIVITY IS THOUGHT TO BE A
RESULT OF THE MAJOR FLARE/CME EVENTS LATE ON MARCH 6.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE THE NEXT 24 HOURS, WITH POSSIBLE EPISODES
OF MINOR STORM LEVELS OCCURRING DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIMES.
STRICTLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL 11-12 MARCH AS THE
CURRENT STORM WEAKENS.
