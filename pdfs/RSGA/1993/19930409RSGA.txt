JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 099 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 APR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY OCCASIONAL SUBFLARE
ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD. STACKED REGIONS 7469
(S11W38) AND 7470 (S03W35) BOTH SHOWED GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD.
7469 SHOWS A WEAK GAMMA CONFIGURATION IN THE CENTRAL PART OF
THE REGION. REGION 7465 (S06W66) SHOWED DECAY TODAY AND WAS
QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THERE IS A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
EVENT. THE MOST LIKELY SITE FOR SUCH ACTIVITY APPEARS FROM THE
SHEARING OF FIELDS BETWEEN 7470'S LEADER AND 7469'S TRAILER:
THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THESE REGIONS SUGGESTS A MECHANISM
FOR DEVELOPING AN INSTABILITY. A DOWNWARD TREND IN BACKGROUND
LEVELS SHOULD BE EXPECTED WITH THE DEPARTURE OF 7465 TOMORROW
AND 7469 LATE ON THE SECOND DAY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BECOME ACTIVE WITH MINOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LAT-
ITUDES SOMETIME DURING THE FIRST DAY IN RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE AND POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL EFFECTS FROM
RECENT LONG DURATION X-RAY EVENTS. MOSTLY MINOR STORM CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE SECOND DAY. CONDITIONS
SHOULD RETURN TO MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS BY DAY THREE.
