IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS
EVENT WAS AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED M1 FLARE AT 0310Z. NEARLY
ALL OF TODAY'S OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY CAME FROM
REGION 7515 (N13E37) SUGGESTING THIS WAS A LIKELY SOURCE FOR
THE M-EVENT AS WELL. THE GROUP CONTINUES TO SPORT A COMPLICATED
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE AND SHOWS EVIDENCE OF A WEAK DELTA CON-
FIGURATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A FAIR CHANCE FOR ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARES FROM REGION 7515.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS. SOME BRIEF ISOLATED MINOR STORM PERIODS WERE
OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED WITH OCCASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS OVER
