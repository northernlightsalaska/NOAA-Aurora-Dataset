REGION 7608 IS A BROAD BIPOLE WITH AN ISOLATED POLE OF TRAILER
POLARITY IN THE LEADER FIELDS. SUNSPOT AREA HERE IS SMALL AT
ABOUT 30 MILLIONTHS. A SMALL REGION EMERGED AT S10W42 AND WAS
NUMBERED AS REGION 7610. OLD REGION 7592 FAILED TO SURVIVE
THE INVISIBLE HEMISPHERE TRANSIT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A LOW LEVEL FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. REGION 7608 IS

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.
SEVERE STORM LEVELS WERE REACHED AT SOME HIGH LATITUDE SITES
DURING PRE-DAWN PERIODS. THE SEVERITY OF THIS DISTURBANCE
WAS UNEXPECTED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS ON 28 OCT. MOSTLY
ACTIVE LEVELS ARE FORECAST FOR 29 OCT AND UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED ON 30 OCT. THIS FORECAST
IS BASED UPON THE EQUATORWARD EXTENSION OF THE NORTHERN
