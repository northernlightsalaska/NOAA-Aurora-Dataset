JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 170 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 19 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. NEW REGION 7524 (N10E64)
PRODUCED C1/SF FLARES AT 19/0015Z AND 19/11332Z. THE EARLIER
EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A WEAK TYPE II BURST. REGION 7524
IS A SMALL SPOT GROUP WITH WEAK TO MODERATE PEAK X-RAY
EMISSION (AS VISIBLE IN YOHKOH IMAGERY). ANOTHER TYPE II WITH
A VERY WEAK LONG DURATION GOES X-RAY ENHANCEMENT OCCURRED AT
19/1903Z. NO SIGNIFICANT DISK ENHANCEMENT WAS OBSERVED WITH
THIS RADIO EVENT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A LOW LEVEL. INTERMITTENT LOW LEVEL CLASS C FLARES ARE
EXPECTED FROM NEW REGION 7524. THERE ARE FAINT INDICATIONS ON
THE YOHKOH DATA OF NEW REGIONS BEYOND THE NORTHEAST LIMB AND
THE TYPE II AT 1903Z MAY HAVE BEEN FROM A FLARE BEYOND THE
LIMB. DUE TO THIS UNCERTAINTY, A MODERATE LEVEL FLARE MUST BE
CONSIDERED A POSSIBILITY FROM THIS AS YET UNSEEN AREA.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET AT MID LATITUDES AND QUIET TO SLIGHTLY
UNSETTLED AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
