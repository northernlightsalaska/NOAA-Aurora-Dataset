JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 364 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 DEC 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE BECAUSE OF A SINGLE,
UNCORRELATED M1 XRAY BURST AT 30/0555UT. REGION 7640 (N08W66)
CONTINUED TO GROW BUT PRODUCED ONLY A SINGLE C5/1N FLARE AT
AT 30/1616UT. REGION 7645 (N11E54) SHOWED RAPID GROWTH THIS
PERIOD AND PRODUCED FIVE C-CLASS FLARES, INCLUDING A C7/SN FLARE
AT 30/1713UT. REGION 7646 (S10E54) SHOWED GOOD DEVELOPEMENT AS
WELL BUT WAS GENERALLY FLARE QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 7640, 7645 AND 7646 ALL HAVE A GOOD
POTENTIAL FOR C-CLASS FLARING. REGIONS 7640 AND 7645 HAVE THE
BEST CHANCE OF OCCASIONAL M-CLASS ACTIVITY AND AN OUTSIDE
CHANCE OF ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS THEN
MOSTLY UNSETTLED. A WELL POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE HAS SO FAR
FAILED TO PRODUCE AN ANTICIPATED MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE.
