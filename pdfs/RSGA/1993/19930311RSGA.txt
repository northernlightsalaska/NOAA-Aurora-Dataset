JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 070 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7440 (S05W44)
PRODUCED TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE: AN M1/SF AT 1517Z. THIS
GROUP CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE DISK IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. THE GROUP PRODUCED ADDITIONAL SMALL FLARES DURING
THE DAY AND APPEARS TO BE IN A SLOW DECAY PHASE. REGION 7448
(N16E63) SHOWED GOOD GROWTH DURING THE DAY AND MUSTERED A C9/SF
AT 1434Z. A 30 DEGREE FILAMENT DISAPPEARED FROM THE SOUTHEAST
PART OF THE DISK SOMETIME BETWEEN 10/2300Z AND 11/0300Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY MODERATE. REGION 7440 IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL
M-CLASS EVENTS AND CONTINUES TO POSSESS SUFFICIENT MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY AND STRENGTH TO POSE A FAIR THREAT FOR A MAJOR FLARE
OR A PROTON PRODUCING EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS.
AN INITIALLY QUIET FIELD BECAME DISTURBED AFTER 0900Z. SINCE
THEN MID-LATITUDES HAVE BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS
AND THE HIGH LATITUDES HAVE WITNESSED MINOR TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT TWELVE HOURS OR SO. CONDITIONS SHOULD BE GENERALLY
UNSETTLED AFTER THAT UNTIL SOMETIME LATE ON THE 13TH (DAY 2)
WHEN EFFECTS FROM YESTERDAY'S LONG DURATION C4 EVENT COULD
PERTURB THE FIELD UP TO ACTIVE LEVELS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS WITH
SOME HIGH LATITUDE MINOR STORM PERIODS ARE POSSIBLE ON THE
THIRD DAY AS EFFECTS CARRY OVER FROM DAY TWO AND AS A RESULT
OF POSSIBLE EFFECTS FROM TODAY'S DISAPPEARING FILAMENT.
