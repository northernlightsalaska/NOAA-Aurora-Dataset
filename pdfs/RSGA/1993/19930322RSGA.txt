IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS WERE
OBSERVED AT SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS FROM 22/0900-1500Z.
THE ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS PROBABLY OCCURRED IN RESPONSE TO
CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
