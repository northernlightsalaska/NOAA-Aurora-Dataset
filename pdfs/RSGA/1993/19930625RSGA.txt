SDF NUMBER 176 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 25 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 7530 (S10E70)
PRODUCED AN M5 LIMB EVENT AT 25/0302Z. THIS WAS REGION 7518
WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR OVER SEVENTY FLARES LAST ROTATION. IT IS THE
CAUSE OF THE UNCORRELATED LIMB EVENTS OF THE LAST FORTY-EIGHT
HOURS. MANY LOOPS AND SURGES HAVE ACCOMPANIED ITS LIMB PASSAGE.
REGION 7529 (S43E37) SHOWS STRONG MAGNETIC GRADIENTS BUT IT HAS
NOT FLARED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 7530 AND 7529 BOTH HAVE A HIGH PROB-
ABILITY OF PRODUCING A MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS DUE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED. THE CORONAL HOLE WILL SOON
LOSE ITS EFFECTIVENESS BUT INCREASED FLARE ACTIVITY SHOULD
KEEP THE FIELD MILDLY DISTURBED.
