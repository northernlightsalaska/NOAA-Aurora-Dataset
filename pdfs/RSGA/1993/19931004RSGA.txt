JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 277 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 OCT 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7590 (N12W17)
PRODUCED ONLY A FEW LOW LEVEL C-CLASS FLARES. THIS REGION
WAS GENERALLY STABLE EXCEPT FOR A SMALL FILAMENT JUST TO THE
SOUTH WHICH DISSOLVED IN PLACE AROUND 04/1400Z. REGION
7592 (S14E28) WAS GENERALLY STABLE AND PRODUCED SEVERAL
SUBFLARES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE MOSTLY
LOW WITH INFREQUENT M-CLASS FLARES EXPECTED FROM REGION 7590.
THIS REGION REMAINS LARGE WITH SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY IN THE
TRAILER SO AN ISOLATED X-CLASS FLARE REMAINS A POSSIBILITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET FOR THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE FORECAST
