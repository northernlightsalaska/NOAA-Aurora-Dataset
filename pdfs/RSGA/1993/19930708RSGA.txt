TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. NO C-CLASS X-RAY
EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST 24 HOURS.  TWO NEW REGIONS

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS.  THESE CONDITIONS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO EFFECTS OF
A HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND STREAM FROM EITHER OF A PAIR OF
LOW LATITUDE, POSITIVE POLARITY CORONAL HOLES ON THE
SOLAR DISK.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE.  RATIONALE FOR THE FORECAST INCLUDES
A LOW LATITUDE SOUTHERN CORONAL HOLE (POSITIVE POLARITY) NEAR
CENTRAL MERIDIAN ON 6 JULY, AND PERSISTENCE.
