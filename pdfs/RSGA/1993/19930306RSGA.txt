MODERATE. REGION 7440 SHOULD CONTINUE ITS M-CLASS ACTIVITY
OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT PREDOMINANTLY MINOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT
48 HOURS. EFFECTS OF A DISAPPEARING FILAMENT ON 2-3 MARCH AS
