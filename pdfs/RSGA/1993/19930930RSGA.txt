JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 273 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 SEP 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S ACTIVITY WAS CHAR-
ACTERIZED BY OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES. ALL OF THESE WERE FROM
REGION 7590 (N12E36). DESPITE THE LOW LEVEL OF FLARE ACTIVITY
THE REGION CONTINUES TO BE IMPRESSIVE LOOKING: GROWTH AND IN-
CREASE OF INTENSITY OF PLAGE WERE NOTED. THE GROUP STILL SHOWS
A DELTA CONFIGURATION IN THE TRAILER AREA. THE 245-610 MHZ SOLAR
RADIO EMISSION BANDS WERE NOISY AND DISPLAYED FREQUENT BURST
ACTIVITY. A SMALL H-TYPE GROUP ROTATED AROUND EAST LIMB AT S10
AND WAS ASSIGNED 7592 (S10E79). THE REMAINING REGIONS ON THE
DISK WERE STABLE AND QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF REGION 7590 SUGGESTS IN-
CREASED PROBABILITY FOR AN M-CLASS LEVEL EVENT. THERE IS A
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FROM THE BEG-
INNING OF THE PERIOD THROUGH ABOUT 1200Z. SINCE THEN CONDITIONS
HAVE BEEN GENERALLY QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE TOMORROW BECOMING MOSTLY
ACTIVE ON DAY TWO. THE PREDICTION FOR ACTIVITY ABOVE BACK-
GROUND IS BASED ON RECURRENCE PATTERNS. CONDITIONS SHOULD BE
MOSTLY UNSETTLED BY DAY THREE.
