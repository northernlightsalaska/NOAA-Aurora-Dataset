JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 172 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. YOHKOH IMAGES FROM
20-21 JUN INDICATE THE VERY LONG DURATION B9 EVENT MENTIONED
ON 20 JUN WAS INDEED FROM THE EAST LIMB. BROAD ENHANCEMENTS
WERE VISIBLE NEAR NE16 AND SE10 WITH EXTENSIVE LOOP SYSTEMS.
THE SOUTHERN AREA WAS THE MOST INTENSE.  CURRENT DISK REGIONS
WERE PREDOMINANTLY QUIET. REGION 7525 (S22W33) GREW TO A SMALL
CLASS D GROUP BUT THE RATE OF EMERGENCE SLOWED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BECOME
LOW. OLD REGION 7518 IS DUE BACK AT THE SOUTHEAST LIMB ON
24-25 JUN. IF IN FACT THE LONG DURATION B9 FLARE WAS FROM
THAT REGION, THE FLARE COULD WELL HAVE BEEN QUITE HIGH IN
PEAK FLUX. IT IS REASONABLE THAT AN X FLARE 4 DAYS BEHIND
THE LIMB COULD RESULT IN THE SIGNATURE SEEN ON 20 JUN.
AN M-CLASS FLARE REMAINS A POSSIBILITY UNTIL THE REGION
COMES INTO FULL VIEW ALLOWING AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR 22 JUN. A CORONAL HOLE
RELATED DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN THE LATTER HALF
OF 23 JUN AND CONTINUE THROUGH 24 JUN.
