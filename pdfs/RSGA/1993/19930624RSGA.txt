JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 175 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 7529 (S13E53)
PRODUCED AN M9/2B FLARE AT 0735Z, WITH ASSOCIATED TYPE II AND
IV RADIO SWEEPS OF IMPORTANCE 3, AND A 2695 MHZ RADIO BURST OF
450 FLUX UNITS. REGION 7528 (N03W07) HAS GROWN RAPIDLY,
MORE THAN DOUBLING ITS SIZE OVERNIGHT. SURGING AT THE EAST LIMB
CONTINUED AT ABOUT S08. AN M4/1F FLARE OCCURRED AT 1727 AT
S12E90, WITH A 2695 MHZ BURST OF 130 FLUX UNITS, FOLLOWED
BY AN M1 AT 1818Z WITH ANOTHER 2695 BURST OF 150 UNITS, PROBABLY
ORIGINATING FROM THE SAME AREA. THIS REGION IS NOT YET VISIBLE
FOR SUNSPOT CLASSIFICATION, SO A REGION NUMBER HAS NOT BEEN
ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 7529 HAS THE HIGHEST PROBABLILITY OF
THE NUMBERED REGIONS OF PRODUCING M-FLARES, WITH A FAIR CHANCE
OF PRODUCING AN X-FLARE. THE AS YET UNUMBERED REGION APPEARS
TO BE QUITE ACTIVE ALREADY, AND MAY BE OLD REGION 7518, WHICH
PRODUCED THREE M-FLARES ON ITS LAST PASSAGE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS, WITH SHORT PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING
AT MID-LATITUDES AND MAJOR STORMING AT HIGH LATITUDES. THIS
ACTIVITY IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE CORONAL HOLE IN THE
WESTERN SOLAR HEMISPHERE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE UNTIL MIDDAY TOMORROW DUE TO
CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS. ENHANCED ACTIVITY DUE TO THE M9 FLARE
IS EXPECTED TO START BY LATE IN THE DAY TOMORROW AND CONTINUE
THROUGH THE SECOND DAY. THE THIRD DAY OF THE PERIOD SHOULD BE
BACK TO UNSETTLED LEVELS.
