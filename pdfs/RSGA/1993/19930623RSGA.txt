JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 174 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S ONLY C-CLASS EVENT
WAS A C1 LONG DURATION EVENT WHICH PEAKED AROUND 23/2100Z. THERE
WAS NO OPTICAL SIGNATURE FOR THIS EVENT, SUGGESTING A SOURCE BE-
HIND THE SOLAR LIMB. INTERESTINGLY, THE X-RAY EVENT WAS JUST
PRECEDED BY A BRIGHT SURGE EVENT ON THE LIMB (BSL) AT S18E90
SHOWING SPIKES AS HIGH AS .18 SOLAR RADII IN H-ALPHA. AN EPL WAS
REPORTED FROM CORONAL OBSERVATIONS IN GOOD TIME CORRESPONDENCE
TO THE BSL. AN ADDITIONAL LONG DURATION X-RAY EVENT (ALSO LACK-
ING AN OPTICAL SIGNATURE) WAS OBSERVED AROUND 0900Z. REGION 7525
(S18W61) UNDERWENT CONSIDERABLE DECAY TODAY. REGION 7528
(N02E07) SHOWED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MATURE SPOTS AND THE
FORMATION OF A BETA-GAMMA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. NEW REGION
7529 (S12E67) ROTATED INTO VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. A GRADUAL INCREASE IN ACTIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS IS
ANTICIPATED ON DAY TWO WITH THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 7518
(S10, L=017).
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A
NOTABLE INCREASE IN ACTIVITY FROM VERY QUIET LEVELS TO
UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE LEVELS OCCURRED JUST AFTER
22/2100Z. CONDITIONS DIMINISHED A BIT FROM 0600-1800Z
BUT APPEARED TO BE PICKING UP AGAIN TO UNSETTLED TO
ACTIVE LEVELS NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS DUE TO CO-
RONAL HOLE EFFECTS. CONDITIONS SHOULD DIMINISH TO MOSTLY UN-
SETTLED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
