JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 251 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 SEP 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY CONTINUED AT A VERY LOW LEVEL.
A SMALL REGION EMERGED ON THE DISK AND WAS NUMBERED AS 7579
(N09W47). RECENT YOHKOH IMAGES VERIFIED THE EXISTENCE OF A
LARGE CORONAL HOLE EXTENDING FROM NEAR THE SOUTHEAST LIMB TO
CENTRAL MERIDIAN NEAR N15. THIS HOLE INCREASED IN EAST-WEST
EXTENT DURING THE PAST 27 DAYS. IT HAS ALSO NEARLY CONNECTED
TO A LOBE OF THE NORTHERN POLAR HOLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT VERY LOW LEVELS FOR THE DURATION OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
FORECAST TO BE UNSETTLED FOR 09 SEP. A CORONAL HOLE RELATED
DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN LATE ON 10 SEP. ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM CONDITIONS SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED ON 11 SEP. THE
CONFIDENCE IN THIS FORECAST IS HIGH DUE TO THE LARGE
LATITUDINAL EXTENT OF THE HOLE(S) EXPECTED TO PRODUCE THE
DISTURBANCE AND THE STRONG 27 DAY RECURRENCE OF ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM CONDITIONS FROM THESE SOLAR LONGITUDES.
