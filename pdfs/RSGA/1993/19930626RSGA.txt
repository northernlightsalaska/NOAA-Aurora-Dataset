JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 177 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 JUN 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7530 (S11E56)
PRODUCED TWO M FLARES, AN M1/1N AT 0145Z AND AN M1/SN AT 1507Z,
AS WELL AS SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES. THIS REGION SHOWED FREQUENT
PLAGE FLUCTUATIONS MOST OF THE DAY AND SEVERAL OF THE FLARES HAD
MULTIPLE CENTERS. REGION 7529 (S12E27) HAS BEEN RELATIVELY
STABLE BUT RETAINS A STRONG MAGNETIC GRADIENT. IF IT HAS REACHED
ITS MAXIMUM SIZE, WE SHOULD SEE MORE FLARES FROM IT DURING ITS
DECAY PHASE. IT PRODUCED ONE C2/SF FLARE THIS PERIOD. TWO NEW
REGIONS WERE NUMBERED: REGION 7531 AT N01W17 AND REGION 7532 AT
N09W23.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  REGION 7530 HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF PRODUCING
A MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE CORONAL HOLE ACTIVITY
ABATED AROUND 0600Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE PERIOD, UNLESS
A SIGNIFICANT SOLAR FLARE OCCURS.
