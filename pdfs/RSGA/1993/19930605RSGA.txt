THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. BRIEF MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM PERIODS WERE OBSERVED AT
SOME HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY IS PROBABLY DUE TO
CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS DURING THE FIRST DAY
DUE TO CONTINUING CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS. BRIEF PERIODS OF MINOR
