JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 301 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 OCT 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7608 (N10E16)
PRODUCED A C1 AT 0924Z. A VERY LONG DURATION B4 X-RAY
ENHANCEMENT OCCURRED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 0212-1110Z. A LOOP
PROMINENCE SYSTEM WAS OBSERVED AT S11E90 SLIGHTLY AFTER THE
ENHANCEMENT AND IS THE LIKELY OPTICAL COUNTERPART. A YOHKOH
IMAGE AT 0830Z ALSO SHOWED ENHANCED LIMB EMISSION AT THAT TIME.
THIS SAME IMAGE ALSO ILLUSTRATED THE SOURCE LOCATION OF A C1
X-RAY BURST AS BEING FROM A PLAGE NEAR S17E70.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
LOW WITH REGION 7608 PRODUCING OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES. THE
LONG DURATION EVENT FROM BEYOND THE EAST LIMB DOES NOT
INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT REGION IS DUE TO APPEAR. THE EVENT WAS
MORE LIKELY FROM AN ERUPTING FILAMENT AS OPPOSED TO A LARGE
FLARE SEVERAL DAYS BEHIND THE LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOME HIGH
LATITUDE SITES EXPERIENCED MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS
NEAR 1200Z.  THIS DISTURBANCE IS MOST LIKELY FROM A HIGH
SPEED STREAM ORIGINATING FROM A HOLE NOW IN THE FAR
NORTHWEST QUADRANT. A SMALL FORBUSH DECREASE WAS OBSERVED
BETWEEN 25-27 OCT INDICATING THAT STORM CONDITIONS ON THOSE
DAYS WERE A RESULT OF A DENSE STREAM WHICH ORIGINATED FROM
NEAR CENTRAL MERIDIAN ON THE SUN ON 21 OCT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED ON 29 OCT EXCEPT DURING LOCAL MIDNIGHT
PERIODS WHEN ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED.
MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS ARE FORECAST FOR 30-31 OCT.
