IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7608 (N10E40) PRO-

THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD THROUGH ABOUT 1600Z. SINCE THEN
THE MID-LATITUDES ATTAINED ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS AND
HIGH LATITUDES SAW SOME MINOR STORM PERIODS. A CORONAL HOLE
APPEARS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR THIS INCREASE IN
ACTIVITY. A FOOTNOTE TO YESTERDAY'S DISTURBANCE - MAGNETO-

THE ACTIVITY FROM 25/1330Z TO 25/1700Z.

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT ACTIVE LEVELS WITH MINOR STORM PERIODS
AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. CONDITIONS SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE ON THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS
