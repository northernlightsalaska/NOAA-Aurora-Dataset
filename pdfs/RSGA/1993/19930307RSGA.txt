JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 066 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7440 (S07E14),
STILL MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX AND BRIGHT, HAS BEEN OMINOUSLY QUIET
SINCE ITS MAJOR FLARE OF A DAY AGO. FINAL REPORTS OF THE TYPE
IV ASSOCIATED WITH THE M7/3B FLARE OF 06/2049Z HAD IT LASTING
NEARLY 14 HOURS. THE LARGEST EVENT REGION 7440 COULD MUSTER
TODAY WAS A C3/0F AT 1309Z. NONETHELESS, THE REGION WARRANTS
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. ELSEWHERE, LITTLE OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS
REPORTED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7440 IS LIKELY TO YIELD ANOTHER M-CLASS OR
LARGER FLARE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. THE
GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUXES ATTAINED NEAR-EVENT CRITERIA,
FOLLOWING THE M7/3B FLARE AT 06/2049Z. THE FLUXES REGISTERED A
SINGLE MAXIMUM OF 11 PFU AT 07/0710Z, AS OPPOSED TO THE REQUIRED
THREE CONSECUTIVE 5-MINUTE VALUES OF 10 PFU OR MORE. THE PROTON
FLUXES ARE STILL ELEVATED, MEASURING JUST LESS THAN 3 PFU NOW.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. THE BRUNT OF THE ACTIVITY SHOULD OCCUR ON 09 MARCH WHEN
EFFECTS FROM THE M7/3B FLARE LATE ON 06 MARCH ARE DUE. PERIODS
OF MAJOR TO SEVERE STORMING MAY EVENTUATE AT THAT TIME. THE
DISTURBANCE SHOULD SLOWLY WEAKEN BY THE END OF THE INTERVAL.
