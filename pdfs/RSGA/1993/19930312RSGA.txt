JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 071 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. TWO MAJOR FLARES OCCURRED
DURING THE PERIOD. THE FIRST WAS AN M7/2B FROM REGION 7448
(N16E53) AT 11/2202Z. THE EVENT WAS FAIRLY IMPULSIVE AND AC-
COMPANIED BY WEAK RADIO BURSTS AND A STRONG TYPE II SWEEP.
THIS GROUP HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW GROWTH AND PRODUCED FREQUENT
SMALL FLARES. THE SECOND MAJOR FLARE CAME FROM REGION 7440
(S05W57) AS AN IMPRESSIVE LONG DURATION M7/3N EVENT WHICH
STARTED AT 1607Z, PEAKED AT 1815Z, AND REACHED HALF POWER (END)
TIME AT 1847Z. THE EVENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERATE TO STRONG
RADIO BURSTS AND MODERATE TYPE II AND TYPE IV SWEEPS. THE REGION
CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST ON THE DISK AT 850 MILLIONTHS AND
SHOWS MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY IN A DELTA CONFIGURATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY MODERATE. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS EVENTS ARE EXPECTED FROM
EITHER OF REGION 7440 OR 7448. BOTH REGIONS CONTINUE TO APPEAR
IMPRESSIVE AND CONTINUE TO POSE A THREAT FOR ANOTHER  MAJOR
FLARE OR PROTON PRODUCING EVENT OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. YESTERDAY'S DISTURBANCE LINGERED ON FROM THE START
OF THE PERIOD THROUGH ABOUT 0300Z ON THE 12TH. SINCE THEN
THE FIELD HAS BEEN GENERALLY UNSETTLED WITH SOME OCCASIONAL
ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES. A 10 PFU GREATER THAN
10MEV PROTON EVENT BEGAN AT 12/2010Z IN RESPONSE TO THE
M7 FLARE FROM REGION 7440. THE GREATER THAN 100 MEV FLUXES
SHOWED A SMALL INCREASE UP TO ABOUT 2 PFU AND WERE TRENDING
DOWN AT FORECAST ISSUE TIME. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV FLUXES
WERE STILL RISING AT FORECAST ISSUE TIME.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. AN
INCREASE IS EXPECTED ON 14-15 MARCH IN RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR
FLARE FROM REGION 7440. MID-LATITUDES ARE EXPECTED TO BE AT
GENERALLY MINOR STORM LEVELS AND HIGH LATITUDES ARE EXPECTED
TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.
