JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 272 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 SEP 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7590 (N12E50) PRO-
DUCED ONLY A FEW LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS EVENTS IN SPITE OF ITS IM-
PRESSIVE SIZE (1140 MILLIONTHS) AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY (BETA-
GAMMA-DELTA). THE DELTA IN THE LEADER DECAYED AS THE MAGNETIC
INVERSION LINE JUST EAST OF THE LARGE LEADER SPOT APPEARED TO
RELAX. THERE IS A WEAK DELTA IN THE TRAILER SPOTS AND THIS
PART OF THE GROUP WAS MOST ACTIVE DURING THE PERIOD. FREQUENT
TYPE III RADIO SWEEPS WERE OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD. THE
REMAINING GROUPS ON THE DISK WERE QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED FLARE POTENTIAL IN REGION
7590.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO ACTIVE. THE ACTIVE
CONDITIONS BEGAN AFTER 0600Z AND CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE PERIOD. SOME ISOLATED MINOR TO MAJOR STORM PERIODS
WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR
THE INCREASE APPEARS TO BE A CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS
DUE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
