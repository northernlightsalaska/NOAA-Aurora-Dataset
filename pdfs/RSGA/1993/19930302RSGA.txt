JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 061 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. A PRESENTLY UNCORRE-
LATED M1 FLARE OCCURRED AT 02/2053UT. FOR NOW, WE WILL ATTRIBUTE
THE FLARE TO NEW REGION 7440 (S05E81), WHICH DISPLAYED ENHANCED
PLAGE AND A SURGE AT THE TIME OF THE FLARE. THIS REGION, JUST
ROTATING ONTO THE DISK, PROMISES TO BE A WINNER. THIS REGION
ALSO PRODUCED A C5/SF FLARE TODAY AT 02/1510UT. REGION 7435
(N07W00) CONTINUED TO GROW BUT PRODUCED ONLY A C4/1F AT
02/1822UT AND TWO SUB FAINT FLARES. REGION 7433 (N13W57)
CONTINUED TO DECAY SLOWLY AND PRODUCED A C1/SF FLARE AT
02/1215UT. FOUR UNCORRELATED C1 FLARES WERE MEASURED AS WELL.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 7435 AND 7440 HAVE THE BEST CLASS C
FLARE POTENTIAL. BOTH HAVE POTENTIAL FOR AN ISOLATED CLASS M
FLARE ALSO.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
