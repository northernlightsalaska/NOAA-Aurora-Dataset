JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 069 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 MAR 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7440 (S05W27)
HAD A FEW C-CLASS FLARES, THE MOST NOTEWORTHY A NEARLY THREE
HOUR-LONG C4/1F AT 1227Z. MODEST DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS ACROSS
THE SPECTRUM WERE PART OF THE EVENT. OTHERWISE, THE REGION
RETAINS A DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AND IS STILL THE
MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHT ON A DULL DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 7440 IS THE BEST HOPE FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY,
BUT TO THIS POINT HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING IN ITS FLARE OUTPUT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS ACTIVE EARLY, THEN QUIET TO
UNSETTLED THE MAJORITY OF THE INTERVAL.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED THE NEXT THREE DAYS. EFFECTS
OF TODAY'S LONG DURATION C4 FLARE MAY BRING EPISODES OF ACTIVE
CONDITIONS LATE ON 13 MARCH.
