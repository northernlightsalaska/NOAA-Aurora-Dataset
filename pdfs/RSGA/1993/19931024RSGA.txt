JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 297 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 OCT 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A
SINGLE C-CLASS X-RAY EVENT OCCURRED AT 0503Z BUT NO OPTICAL
EVENT WAS REPORTED.  NO NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED.  OLD REGION
7590 HAS RETURNED AS WEAK, SPOTLESS PLAGE. A MAJOR FILAMENT
(29 DEGREES LONG CENTERED NEAR N25W68) BEGAN LIFTING AT ABOUT
1245Z AND EVOLVED INTO AN EPL EXTENDING OUT TO .33 SOLAR RADIUS
NEAR N22W90. THE ERUPTION ENDED BY 1422Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW. ONLY ISOLATED C-CLASS X-RAY EVENTS ARE LIKELY FROM
REGIONS PRESENTLY OBSERVED.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET FOR THE PAST 24
HOURS. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS OCCURRED EARLY IN THE
PERIOD BUT THAT ACTIVITY CEASED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE BASED ON THE ARRIVAL OF DISTURBED SOLAR
WIND ORIGINATING WITH A FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE AND CORONAL
X-RAY EVENT NEAR CENTER SOLAR DISK ON 21 OCTOBER. UNSETTLED
TO OCCASIONALLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS SHOULD THEN PREVAIL FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. TODAY'S EPL IS NOT EXPECTED
TO IMPACT EARTH.
