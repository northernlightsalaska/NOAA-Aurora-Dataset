JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 267 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 SEP 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7585 (S07W02)
CONTINUED ITS DRAMATIC GROWTH, NOW MEASURING 200 MILLIONTHS
IN WHITE LIGHT AREA AND NUMBERING 20 SPOTS. THE MAGNETIC
CONFIGURATION REMAINS ESSENTIALLY BIPOLAR, AS EVIDENCED BY
ITS ABILITY TO PRODUCE JUST SMALL FLARES TO THIS POINT. THE
LARGEST OFFERING TODAY WAS A C1/0F AT 0517Z. THIS IS THE SOLE
SPOTTED REGION ON AN OTHERWISE DULL DISK. TODAY'S 10.7 CM
FLUX IS THE LOWEST IN YEARS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW, PENDING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN REGION 7585.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED. THE GEO-
PHYSICAL RESPONSE TO THE LOBE OF THE SOUTHERN POLAR CROWN
CORONAL HOLE HAS BEEN MODEST.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO MILDLY ACTIVE EARLY ON, THEN
RELAX TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE END OF THE INTERVAL.
