SDF NUMBER 303 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 OCT 1993
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TWO C1-CLASS BURSTS WERE
OBSERVED. REGION 7613 (S12E67) SHOWED ITSELF AS A MODERATE SIZE
CLASS D GROUP WHICH IS NEW FROM LAST ROTATION. DUE TO SPOT
ORIENTATION, IT APPEARS TO BE BIPOLAR. REGION 7608 (N11W11) GREW
SLIGHTLY IN WHITE LIGHT. A DENSE 10 DEGREE LONG FILAMENT LOCATED
NEAR S15E35 FADED BETWEEN 29/1151-2245Z. THE CORONAL HOLE THAT
CAUSED THE GEOMAGNETIC DISTURBANCE ON 08-11 OCT IS AGAIN VISIBLE
ON THE SUN. ITS AREA, LOCATION, AND INTENSITY ARE ROUGHLY THE
SAME AS LAST ROTATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A LOW LEVEL. AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE IS POSSIBLE FROM
REGION 7613 AND TO A LESSER DEGREE REGION 7608.

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET AT ALL LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE MOSTLY QUIET AT MID LATITUDES AND QUIET TO
