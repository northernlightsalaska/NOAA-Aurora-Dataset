SDF NUMBER 303 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONE OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED
C2 X-RAY BURST OCCURRED AT 30/0541Z. REGION 6327 ROTATED OUT OF
VIEW. REGION 6337 (S14W36) DISPLAYED A MINOR INCREASE IN
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE AND PRODUCED A FEW SUBFLARES. REGION 6344
(S21W65) GREW FROM AN A- TO A D-CLASS REGION, BUT PRODUCED ONLY
A SINGLE SUBFLARE. MAGNETIC ANALYSIS REVEALED FAIRLY STRONG
GRADIENTS WITHIN REGION 6345 (S04E48) WHICH PRODUCED TWO
SUBFLARES LATE IN THE PERIOD. NEW REGION 6347 (S18E76) WAS
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE STORMING OCCURRED NEAR 30/0300Z,
BUT SUBSIDED TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS BY 0900Z. IT MAY
HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS DURING THE FIRST
DAY DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
THE REMAINING DAYS SHOULD SEE THE FIELD AT UNSETTLED LEVELS.
