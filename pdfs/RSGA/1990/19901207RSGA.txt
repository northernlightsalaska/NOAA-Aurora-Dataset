JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 341 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO AN M1/1F FLARE
AT 1411Z FROM REGION 6397 (N10E05). THIS REGION CONTINUES TO
GROW AND IS CURRENTLY THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK. IT SHOWS
SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. REGION 6387 (S24W40) PRODUCED FREQUENT
SMALL C-CLASS FLARES, BUT IS NO LONGER GROWING. SOME GROWTH WAS
OBSERVED FROM 6404 (S18E12) BUT IT ONLY PRODUCED ONE C-CLASS
SUBFLARE DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  REGION 6397 IS  THE PRIMARY THREAT FOR ACTIVITY
ALTHOUGH THOUGH REGION 6395 (N17W02) MIGHT ALSO BE A SOURCE
FOR M-FLARES GIVEN ITS SIZE AND PROXIMITY TO 6397. OLD REGION
6368 (N17, L-025), WHICH PRODUCED SEVERAL M-CLASS FLARES ON
ITS PREVIOUS TRANSIT, IS DUE TO RETURN ON 10 DECEMBER AND IS
LIKELY TO INCREASE BACKGROUND FLUX LEVELS. IT MAY ALSO PROVE
TO BE AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE FOR SOLAR ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TOMORROW, DECLINING TO QUIET
TO UNSETTLED FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS.
