JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 295 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO AN M2/SF FLARE
FROM REGION 6322 (S08W46) AT 0641Z. THIS GROUP CONTINUES TO
DECAY QUICKLY.  REGION 6327 (N19E04) IS THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE
DISK AND APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY IN THE
REGION'S CENTER. REGION 6331 (N19E24) IS ALSO SHOWING SOME
DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEXITY INCLUDING HINTS OF DEVELOPMENT OF
A WEAK DELTA CONFIGURATION. 6331 PRODUCED A C4/SF AT 2002Z.
THE REST OF THE ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF A FEW SUBFLARES, NOTABLY
FROM NEW REGION 6337 (S13E68), NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW, BUT WITH A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED LOW LEVEL M-CLASS
FLARE FROM EITHER REGION 6237 OR 6331. REGION 6322 IS NOT EX-
PECTED TO PRODUCE ANY MORE NOTABLE FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH A FEW BRIEF
ISOLATED PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE INITIALLY UNSETTLED BUT IS EXPECTED TO BECOME
ACTIVE ON THE SECOND DAY IN RESPONSE TO A FILAMENT THAT DIS-
APPEARED ON 19 OCTOBER. CONDITIONS SHOULD SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY
UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE THIRD DAY.
