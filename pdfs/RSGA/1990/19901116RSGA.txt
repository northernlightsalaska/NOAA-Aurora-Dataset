JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 320 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 NOV 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6368 (N18E38) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S LARGEST EVENT: A C7/SF AT 0224Z. THE REGION IS
DEVELOPING SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AS IT CONTINUES TO GROW
(NOW AN FKI BETA-GAMMA-DELTA OF 2560 MILLIONTHS AREA). A DELTA
CONFIGURATION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE LARGE
TRAILER SPOT, SHOWING A CHANGE OF 400 GAUSS OVER ABOUT 3 DE-
GREES. A SECOND WEAKER DELTA APPEARS TO BE FORMING JUST SOUTH
OF THE LARGE NEGATIVE LEADER SPOT, FORMING AN EAST-WEST INVER-
SION LINE THAT COULD DEVELOP SHEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
NONETHELESS THE REGION HAS ONLY PRODUCED C-CLASS FLARES AND
POSSESSES ONLY INTENSITY 2 TO OCCASIONALLY INTENSITY 3 PLAGE.
THE OTHER REGIONS WERE RELATIVELY QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH REGION 6368 THE EXPECTED SOURCE OF THE ACTIVITY.
IN PARTICULAR, IF THE NEW FLUX CONTINUES TO EMERGE, OR IF SHEAR
CAN DEVELOP IN THE LEADING PORTION OF THE REGION, A MAJOR FLARE
IS LIKELY TO OCCUR.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS. AN INITIALLY QUIET FIELD GRADUALLY BECAME AC-
TIVE BEGINNING AT ABOUT 03Z AND LASTING THROUGH THE REMAIND-
ER OF THE DAY. THE DISTURBANCE WAS MOST LIKELY A RESULT OF
THE 19 DEGREE FILAMENT THAT DISAPPEARED ON 13 NOVEMBER.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT ACTIVE LEVELS THROUGH ABOUT MID-DAY
TOMORROW, AND IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO UNSETTLED WITH OC-
CASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS THEREAFTER. RECURRENT EFFECTS FROM
A CORONAL HOLE MAY INCREASE ACTIVITY SOMEWHAT, BEGINNING LATE
ON THE THIRD DAY.
