TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S LARGEST FLARE WAS
A C3/SF FROM REGION 6233 (N13W59) AT 0146Z. THE GROUP SHOWED
CONSIDERABLE DECAY AND SIMPLIFICATION AS THE MAIN MAGNETICALLY
COMPLEX SPOT IS BREAKING APART. THE GROUP IS STILL JUST BARELY
MAINTAINING A DELTA CONFIGURATION. A 15 DEGREE PORTION OF FIL-
AMENT MATERIAL  NEAR N10E40  DISAPPEARED SOMETIME  BETWEEN
01/1331Z AND 02/1309Z. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED ON
THE EAST LIMB AT S19 FROM 1442Z TO 1503Z. THE REMAINDER OF
THE SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS WERE ESSENTIALLY STABLE AND QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6233 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS FLARE SOMETIME DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. REGIONS 6238
(S13W02), 6246 (S15E47), AND 6244 (N12E17) MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE
SOME SMALL FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET. YESTERDAY'S DISTURBED LEVELS
DID NOT PERSIST.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED TOMORROW, BECOMING UNSETTLED
TO ACTIVE ON THE SECOND DAY AND RETURNING TO UNSETTLED BY THE
THIRD DAY. THE INCREASE IS EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THE FILA-
MENT WHICH DISAPPEARED ON 01 SEPTEMBER.
