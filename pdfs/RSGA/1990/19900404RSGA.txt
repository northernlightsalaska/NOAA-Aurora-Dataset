FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 094
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 04 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6007 (N23E67) PRO-
DUCED A MAJOR FLARE (M7/SN) AT 1338Z. THE EVENT WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH LOOPS, MODERATE RADIO BURSTS, AND A STRONG TYPE IV SWEEP.
THE REGION PRODUCED ADDITIONAL UPPER LEVEL C-FLARES DURING THE
PERIOD, BUT HAS BEEN REMARKABLY CALM SINCE THE M7 FLARE . OB-
SERVATIONS SO FAR INDICATE THAT THE GROUP IS SURPRISINGLY SMALL,
WITH AN AREA OF ABOUT 270 MILLIONTHS IN A SIMPLE, D-TYPE CON-
FIGURATION. THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK CONTINUES TO BE 6001
(N21E10), WHICH PRODUCED A FEW LOW LEVEL C-FLARES DURING THE
PERIOD. ACTIVE SURGING WAS REPORTED ON THE EAST LIMB AT S43,
SUGGESTING THAT AN ADDITIONAL REGION MAY ROTATE INTO VIEW IN
THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK WAS RELATIVELY
QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE PRINCIPAL THREAT
FOR ACTIVITY IS REGION 6007, ALTHOUGH REGION 6001 MIGHT ALSO
CONTRIBUTE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
SOME BRIEF, ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH
LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED WITH OCCASIONAL ACTIVE
PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. A SLIGHT
ENHANCEMENT IS EXPECTED TOMORROW IN RESPONSE TO SOLAR ACTIVITY
OF 01 APRIL.
