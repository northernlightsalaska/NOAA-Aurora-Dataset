JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 222 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 6203 (N18E68)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS, AN M7/2B
AT 10/1820Z.  THIS FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG TYPE IV
SWEEP AND A 2800 MHZ (10.7 CM) RADIO BURST OF 883 SFU.  THIS
REGION OBVIOUSLY CONTAINS MODERATE MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY, ALTHOUGH
THIS IS NOT APPARENT BY ITS H-ALPHA AND WHITE LIGHT APPEARANCE
NEAR THE EAST LIMB.  REGION 6197 (N14E39) HAS STABILIZED
IN ITS DEVELOPMENT.  IT HAS ONLY PRODUCED A FEW SMALL FLARES
SINCE YESTERDAY.  NEW REGION 6205 (S18E07) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH THE CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.  REGIONS
6197 AND 6203 ARE EXPECTED TO BE THE PRIMARY FLARE PRODUCERS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
