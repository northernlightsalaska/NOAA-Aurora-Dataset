REGIONS 6280 (N13E19) AND 6283 (S07E51). REGIONS 6280 AND 6283
NOW DOMINATE THE DISK IN SIZE AND STRENGTH OF MAGNETIC FIELDS
BUT POSSESS FAIRLY SIMPLE STRUCTURES.

LOW. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT
FROM REGION 6280.

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS INITIALLY QUIET UNTIL ABOUT 0300Z
WHEN CONDITIONS ATTAINED UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS. SOME
BRIEF PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED AT
HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
