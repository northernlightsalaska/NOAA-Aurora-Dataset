JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 288 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6321 (S23E25)
PRODUCED THE DAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE, AN M2/1N AT 0135Z. LATER
IT GENERATED A C8/1N WITH TYPE II AT 0246Z. FREQUENT SUBFLARES
HAVE BEEN NOTED FROM 6321 ALL PERIOD. THIS SPOT GROUP MAY BE
TWO DISTINCT REGIONS WITH IT SPLITTING ALONG A LINE RUNNING
EAST-WEST THROUGH ITS CENTER. ELSEWHERE, FREQUENT SUBFLARES HAVE
BEEN THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN REGIONS 6322 (S07E35) AND 6316
(N17W52), BOTH OF WHICH HAVE GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY IN WHITE LIGHT.
ABUTTED REGIONS 6311 (N15W29) AND 6312 (N10W22) HAVE ALSO
YIELDED MANY SMALL FLARES. NEW REGIONS 6324 (N08E06) AND 6325
(S13E55) WERE NUMBERED, BRINGING THE TOTAL OF SPOTTED REGIONS
NOW VISIBLE TO 17.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE BACKGROUND SOFT X-RAY FLUX IS ABOVE THE C1 LEVEL
AND THE ABUNDANCE OF FLARE-PRODUCING REGIONS MAKES ISOLATED
M-CLASS ACTIVITY LIKELY. REGION 6321 OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE OF
ENERGETIC ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS SINCE EARLY IN THE DAY. THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURB-
ANCE MAY BE THE EFFECTS OF A NUMBER OF FILAMENT DISAPPEAR-
ANCES BETWEEN 10-11 OCT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
