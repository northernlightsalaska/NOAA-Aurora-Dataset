JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 233 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 21 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGIONS 6214
(S11W35), 6223 (S13E34), AND 6226 (S22E37) HAVE EACH
SHOWN NOTABLE GROWTH THROUGHOUT. REGION 6226 PRODUCED
THREE C-CLASS FLARES: A C9/SF EVENT AT 21/0433Z, A C9/1F
AT 21/0525Z, AND A C9/SF AT 21/1605Z. THIS REGION WAS ALSO
THE MAIN CONTRIBUTER TO A LONG DURATION M1 X-RAY ENHANCEMENT
THAT WAS IN PROGRESS AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. REGION
6214, ALTHOUGH DISPLAYING SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN SPOT AREA,
HAS ONLY PRODUCED VERY ISOLATED SUBFLARING. REGION 6223
PRODUCED AN M1/1F TENFLARE AT 21/0932Z. AN ERUPTIVE
PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED FROM DEPARTING REGION 6199 AT
21/1411Z.  NEW REGIONS 6229 (N11W32) AND 6230 (S27E63)
WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6214, 6223, AND 6226 PROVIDE A REASONABLE
THREAT FOR M-CLASS FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS WITH OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF MINOR
STORMING OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD.
