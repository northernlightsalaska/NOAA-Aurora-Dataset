JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 214 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  REGION 6172 (25W58) WAS
THE MOST ACTIVE, PRODUCING NUMEROUS SUBFLARES AND FOUR C-CLASS
FLARES INCLUDING THE LARGEST A C8/SN AT 2135Z.  THIS REGION HAS
SHOWN SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS GROWING FROM
50 MILLIONTHS ON 31 JULY TO OVER 600 MILLIONTHS TODAY.  THREE
NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED 6188 (N23E66), 6189 (N06E56) AND
6190 (N10W54).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND ACTIVITY EXHIBITED
BY REGION 6172 MAKES MORE M-CLASS FLARES FROM IT A POSSIBILITY.
REGIONS 6185 (N24E47) AND 6186 (N16E50) ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE
OF ADDITIONAL M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED.  THE PERIOD
BEGAN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS AND BECAME MOSTLY QUIET BY
ABOUT 1200Z.  THE SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON EVENT REACHED A
MAXIMUM OF 230 PFU AT 01/2015Z, FELL BELOW EVENT THRESHOLDS
AT 02/1805Z BUT REMAINS ENHANCED.  THE POLAR CAP ABSORBTION
EVENT ENDED AT 1500Z.  A SLIGHT FOREBUSH DECREASE WAS NOTED
TODAY AND CONTINUES IN PROGRESS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.
THEN PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE IN RESPONSE
TO A CORONAL HOLE.  ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET
TO UNSETTLED AGAIN BY LATE ON DAY TWO THROUGH THE END OF
THE PERIOD.
