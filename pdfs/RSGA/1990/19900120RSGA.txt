SDF NUMBER 020
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 20 JAN 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH  DUE TO AN M5 FLARE  AT
1330Z WHICH WAS UNCORRELATED OPTICALLY. THE EVENT WAS IMPULSIVE
AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FAIRLY STRONG DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. AD-
DITIONAL M-FLARES OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD: AN M4/1B AT 1251Z
FROM  REGION 5890 (S12E25) AND  AN M1/1N AT 1150Z  FROM 5882
(N21W40). REGION 5882 ALSO PRODUCED LONG DURATION C9/SF FROM
1705-1812Z WITH THE MAXIMUM AT 1743Z.  FOUR ADDITIONAL NEW
REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY, THREE OF WHICH ARE ROTATING INTO
VIEW FROM THE EAST. THE REMARKABLE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF
ACTIVE REGIONS HAS RAISED BACKGROUND LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY OVER
THE LAST FEW DAYS. SURGE ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED ON EAST LIMB AT
N14 AND S17.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR HIGH LEVELS. REGIONS 5890 AND
5882 CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY THREATS FOR THE EVENT LEVEL
FLARES. REGIONS 5892 (S28E45), 5897 (S11E59) AND 5889 (S10E15)
ALSO SHOW SOME POTENTIAL FOR M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET UNTIL SHORTLY AFTER
0600Z WHEN CONDITIONS BECAME GENERALLY UNSETTLED, WITH SOME
ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED TOMORROW, AND IS EXPECTED
TO BECOME UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS
IN RESPONSE TO A CORONAL HOLE.
