FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 103
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 13 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6021 (S15E68)
PRODUCED THE LARGEST FLARE OF THE DAY: A C9/SN AT 13/0039Z.
STRONG CALCIUM XV EMISSION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS GROWING
REGION. THE SAME WAS TRUE OF REGION 6022 (N30E67) WHICH PRODUCED
SEVERAL FLARES INCLUDING A C6/2F AT 13/1840Z. THERE IS SOME
EVIDENCE OF A POSSIBLE DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION IN THE
TRAILER PORTION OF THIS REGION. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED C5
X-RAY FLARE OCCURRED AT 13/0508Z AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
TYPE II RADIO SWEEP (ESTIMATED SHOCK SPEED 2500 KM/SEC). AN
ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE ON LIMB (EPL) OCCURRED NEAR S54E90 AT
13/1123Z; ANOTHER OCCURRED NEAR S27W90 AT 13/1447Z. NEW REGION
6024 (S08E33) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6022 APPEARS TO BE THE GREATEST THREAT FOR
M-CLASS FLARES. THIS REGION ALSO PROVIDES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE. REGIONS 6017 (N22W08) AND 6021 MAY
PRODUCE M-CLASS ACTIVITY AS WELL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. MINOR TO SEVERE STORMING WAS
OBSERVED AT HIGHER LATITUDES. A DISCRETE SOURCE FOR THIS
CONTINUED STORMING HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE
HIGHER LATITUDES ARE EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY MINOR STORM
LEVELS DURING THE FIRST DAY DECLINING TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE BALANCE OF THE PERIOD.
