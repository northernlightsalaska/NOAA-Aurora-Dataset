6226 POSE A THREAT FOR ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE
EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO EFFECTS FROM A LARGE FILAMENT THAT
