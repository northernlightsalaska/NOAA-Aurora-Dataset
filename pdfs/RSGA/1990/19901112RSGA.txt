JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 316 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 NOV 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6361 (N08W10) PRO-
DUCED THE MAJORITY OF TODAY'S ACTIVITY, INCLUDING TODAY'S LARG-
EST EVENT, A C9/SN AT 11/2203Z. THE REGION APPEARS TO BE DECAY-
ING SOMEWHAT, BUT CONTINUES TO BE MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX AND FLARE
PRODUCTIVE. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED ON WEST LIMB AT
S20 (LOCATION OF EXITING REGION 6347) BETWEEN 1430 AND 1522Z.
REGION 6364 (S31W08) SHOWED STEADY GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD BUT
PRODUCED ONLY SMALL FLARES. REGION 6358 (N16W33) CONTINUES TO BE
THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK BUT COULD ONLY PRODUCE ONE SUB-
FLARE. NEW REGION 6368 (N19E78) ROTATED INTO VIEW TODAY AS A
SIMPLE H-TYPE GROUP.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW, BUT WITH A FAIR CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE, PRIMARILY DUE TO REGION 6361. REGIONS 6364 AND 6358
MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY WITH OCCASIONAL SMALL FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED WITH SOME ISOLATED BRIEF ACTIVE
PERIODS TOMORROW. THE INCREASE IS EXPECTED DUE TO THE LONG DUR-
ATION M2 FLARE OF 11 NOVEMBER. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DE-
CLINE GRADUALLY THEREAFTER AND SHOULD BE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS BY THE THIRD DAY.
