TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6126 (S12E16)
DISPLAYED MINOR SPOT GROWTH AND PRODUCED NUMEROUS SUBFLARES
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. MODEST SPOT GROWTH WAS ALSO NOTED
IN REGION 6131 (S20E26) WHICH PRODUCED SEVERAL C-CLASS
EVENTS OF WHICH A C3/SF FLARE AT 30/0105Z WAS THE LARGEST.
REGION 6133 (N18E56) IS THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLEX AREA ON THE
DISK AND CONTINUES TO GROW IN SPOT NUMBER AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. AN M3/1B FLARE WITH MINOR RADIO BURST EMISSIONS
BETWEEN 2695-15400 MHZ WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THIS REGION AT
29/2235Z. A C9/SF FLARE AT 30/1949Z WAS ALSO NOTED. REGION 6127
(N09E21) IS ANOTHER AREA DISPLAYING MARKED GROWTH AND FREQUENT
SUBFLARING. NEW REGIONS ASSIGNED TODAY INCLUDE 6136
(S40W34), 6137 (S14E31), 6138 (N22E78), AND 6139 (S16E53).

MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS
6122 (S21W20), 6126, 6127 (N09E21), 6131, OR 6133. REGION
6133 ALSO SHOWS INCREASING POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR FLARING.
