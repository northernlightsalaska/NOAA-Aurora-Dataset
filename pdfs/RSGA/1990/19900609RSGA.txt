SDF NUMBER 160
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 09 JUN 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. SEVERAL UNCORRELATED
LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS X-RAY EVENTS STARTED OUT THE PERIOD. REGION
6089 (N09W05) CONTINUED TO MATURE. AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE LEAD TO THE OCCURENCE OF AN M2/2B TENFLARE
OBSERVED AT 09/1651Z. A MAJOR TYPE IV SWEEP AND MODEST RADIO
BURST EMISSIONS ACCOMPANIED THIS EVENT. OCCASIONAL SUBFLARING
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THIS REGION.
REGION 6100 (S13E62) CONTINUES TO ROTATE INTO VIEW DISPLAYING A
LARGE LEADING SPOT SO FAR. THE APPEARANCE OF AN ARCH FILAMENT
SYSTEM TRAILING THIS SPOT COUPLED WITH AN EXTENSIVE PLAGE
FIELD SUGGEST A MODESTLY COMPLEX SPOT GROUP FOLLOWS. AN M1/1N
FLARE WAS OBSERVED IN THIS REGION AT 09/1426Z. A C4/1F FLARE
ACCOMPANIED BY BRIGHT SURGING WAS NOTED ON THE LIMB NEAR N34
AT 09/2015Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. OCCASIONAL C-CLASS ACTIVITY AND ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARING IS POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS 6089 AND 6100. THE REMAINING
REGIONS MAY CONTRIBUTE ISOLATED SUBFLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO MINOR
STORM LEVELS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES WITH MAJOR STORMING
OBSERVED BRIEFLY AT HIGH LATITUDES. SEVERAL RECENT
DISAPPEARING SOLAR FILAMENTS AND A NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
CORONAL HOLE ARE POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR THIS ACTIVITY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE LEVELS THE NEXT TWO DAYS RETURNING
TO UNSETTLED LEVELS THEREAFTER.
