JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 234 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THREE LARGE, IMPRESSIVE
REGIONS CURRENTLY DOMINATE THE ACTIVITY ON THE DISK. REGION
6214 (S11W48) CONTINUED ITS GROWTH IN SPOT AREA AND MAIN-
TAINS A LARGE, WELL DEFINED ARCH FILAMENT SYSTEM. THIS
REGION HOWEVER REMAINED QUIET THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. REGION
6223 (S12E20) APPEARS TO HAVE REACHED MATURITY WITH SOME
DECAY NOW EXHIBITED. NUMEROUS C-CLASS FLARES WERE ATTRIBUTED
TO THIS AREA. THE LARGEST: A C6/SF FLARE AT 22/1623Z. REGION
6226 (S22E23) DISPLAYED MODEST SPOT AREA GROWTH AND ALSO
PRODUCED A C6/SF FLARE AT 22/0759Z. THE 1700Z 10.7 CM SOLAR
FLUX CLIMBED TO 313 SFU TODAY. THE LAST TIME THE FLUX
MEASUREMENT SURPASSED THE 300 SFU MARK WAS 15 JUNE 1989 WHEN A
VALUE OF 324 SFU WAS OBSERVED. UNCORRELATED TYPE II AND
TYPE IV SWEEP FREQUENCY BURSTS WERE OBSERVED AT 22/1958Z AND
22/2003Z RESPECTIVELY. NEW REGIONS 6231 (N12E63) AND 6232
WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE THREAT OF M-CLASS FLARING REMAINS POSSIBLE
FROM REGIONS 6214, 6223, AND 6226.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THIS ACTIVITY IS BELIEVED
TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH EFFECTS FROM A LARGE FILAMENT THAT
DISAPPEARED 17-18 AUGUST.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE LEVELS THE FIRST DAY WITH THE
TREND TOWARDS GENERALLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS THEREAFTER.
