FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 088
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 29 MAR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. STRONG SURGING IS
OCCURRING IN REGION 5984 (S13W82) AS IT APPROACHES WEST LIMB.
STRUCTURALLY THE REGION HAS BEEN STABLE. REGION 5988 (S06W53),
THE SITE OF THE PROTON FLARE OF 28/0751Z, WAS QUIET AS IT
SLOWLY DECAYED. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED: 5998 (S16W00)
AND 5999 (S10E70).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. ALTHOUGH UNPRODUCTIVE TODAY, REGIONS 5984 OR 5988
STILL APPEAR CAPABLE OF ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. GREATER THAN
10 MEV PROTON FLUX PASSED EVENT THRESHOLD (10 PFU) AT 0915Z,
REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 16 PFU AT 1005Z, AND DROPPED BELOW
EVENT LEVEL AT 1020Z. THE M4/2N FLARE FROM REGION 5988 AT
28/0751Z IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THESE PARTICLES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE
NEXT 24 HOURS. SOLAR WIND DATA INDICATE A SHOCK IN THE
INTERPLANETARY MEDIUM THAT MAY BE PROPAGATING EARTHWARD. IF
THIS ACTIVITY OCCURS, IT SHOULD DIMINISH WITHIN A DAY.
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO END THE PERIOD.
