JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 328 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 24 NOV 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6377 (S04W01)
DEVELOPED RAPIDLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AND PRODUCED AN M3/1B
FLARE AT 24/1425Z. MINOR DISCRETE TRANSPECTRAL RADIO EMISSIONS,
INCLUDING A 250 SFU TENFLARE, ACCOMPANIED THE FLARE. THE REGION
ALSO PRODUCED FOUR C-CLASS SUBFLARES. REGION 6368 (N17W65)
PRODUCED FREQUENT SUBFLARES WHILE DISPLAYING EVIDENCE OF VERY
GRADUAL DECAY. HOWEVER, THE REGION REMAINS MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX,
ESPECIALLY IN THE TRAILER, WHERE A DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION
PERSISTS. NEW REGIONS 6380 (S07W11) AND 6381 (S04E73) WERE
ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 6368 AND 6377 ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
C-CLASS ACTIVITY. BOTH REGIONS ALSO DISPLAY POTENTIAL FOR
ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED.
