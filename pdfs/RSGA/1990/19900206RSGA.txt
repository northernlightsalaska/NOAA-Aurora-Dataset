FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 037
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 06 FEB 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. A VERY SLOW RISING X-RAY
ENHANCEMENT BEGAN ABOUT 1800Z AND CONTINUES AT THIS WRITING. THE
PEAK SO FAR IS C3. THIS MAY BE RELATED TO A SLOWLY CHANGING,
VERY TENUOUS PROMINENCE LOCATED NEAR N45 AT EAST LIMB. A WEAK
TYPE II SWEEP AT 2019Z WAS REPORTED BY TWO OBSERVATORIES.
ELSEWHERE, THE FIVE SPOTTED REGIONS ON THE DISK WERE STABLE OR
DECAYING, AND THE 10.7 CM. RADIO FLUX DROPPED AGAIN. TODAY'S
VALUE OF 151 IS THE LOWEST SINCE 04 DECEMBER 1988.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE LOW. MODERATE LEVELS COULD BE REACHED IN THE NEXT
72 HOURS IF THE LONGITUDES NOW AT EAST LIMB PROVE TO HAVE
SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS THE
FIRST HALF OF THE INTERVAL. QUIET CONDITIONS WERE IN EFFECT
THE LAST TWELVE HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
