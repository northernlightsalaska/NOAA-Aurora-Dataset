JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 204 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 JUL 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6171 (N11E63) WAS
THE MOST ACTIVE REGION PRODUCING THREE C-CLASS FLARES. THE
LARGEST OF THESE WAS A C7/1N AT 23/0007Z ACCOMPANIED BY MINOR
DISCRETE RADIO EMISSIONS. REGION 6162 (N06E21) PRODUCED SEVERAL
SUBFLARES AS IT CONTINUED TO GRADUALLY GROW IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. IN CONTRAST, REGION 6161 (S28W09) REMAINED IN A
GRADUAL DECAY PHASE. AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED WEAK TYPE II
SWEEP OCCURRED AT 23/0405Z. ITS ESTIMATED SHOCK SPEED WAS 1200
KM/SEC. NEW REGIONS 6172 (S22E69), 6173 (N21W23), AND 6174
(S11E34) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6162 DISPLAYS POTENTIAL FOR M-CLASS FLARE
PRODUCTION. REGIONS 6171 AND 6172 ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE
OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
