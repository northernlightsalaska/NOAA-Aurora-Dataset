FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 142
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 22 MAY 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6063 (N35W56) PRO-
DUCED AN X5/2B FLARE AT 2219Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOOPS,
STRONG DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS, AND A STRONG TYPE IV SWEEP. THE
REGION HAS BEEN REMARKABLY QUIET SINCE THEN, PRODUCING ONLY
OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES, AND APPEARS TO BE GRADUALLY DECAYING AND
SIMPLIFYING, ALTHOUGH IT RETAINS A MAGNETIC DELTA CONFIGURATION.
REGION 6064 (S15W52) PRODUCED THE ONLY OTHER M-CLASS OR GREATER
FLARE: AN M3/1F AT 0057Z. THIS GROUP IS ALSO FRAGMENTING AND
SIMPLIFYING. THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK WAS RELATIVELY QUIET
AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6063 AND 6064 ARE THE PRINCIPAL FLARE
THREATS. A GRADUAL DOWNWARD TREND IS EXPECTED AS THE REGIONS
CONTINUE TO DECLINE. BACKGROUND LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP
MARKEDLY ON THE THIRD DAY AS THESE TWO REGIONS DEPART THE VIS-
IBLE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS WITH
A PERIOD OF MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS FROM 06-09Z. THE DAY
BEGAN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS. STORMING BEGAN AROUND 06Z AND
LASTED FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE DAY. THE SOURCE OF THE
DISTURBANCE IS UNCERTAIN BUT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH DISAPPEAR-
ING FILAMENT ACTIVITY WHICH OCCURRED OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.
A PROTON EVENT BEGAN AT 2355Z IN RESPONSE TO THE X5 FLARE AND
CONTINUES IN PROGRESS. THE PEAK FLUX WAS 410 PFU AT GREATER
THAN 10 MEV AT 0750Z. THE EVENT HAD A HARD SPECTRUM AS HIGH
ENERGY PARTICLES WERE ENHANCED BY THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE
(19 PFU AT GREATER THAN 100 MEV AT 0500Z) AND RESULTED IN A
BRIEF GROUND LEVEL EVENT. A PCA EVENT BEGAN AT 0445Z, PEAKED
AT 5.5 DB AT 0745Z AND ENDED AT 2000Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS OVER THE NEXT
THREE DAYS. THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO PERSIST
THROUGH ABOUT MIDDAY TOMORROW. EFFECTS FROM THE M4 FLARE OF
21 MAY ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SOME ACTIVITY ON THE SECOND DAY.
EFFECTS FROM TODAY'S X5 FLARE ARE EXPECTED TO START LATE ON
THE SECOND DAY AND LAST THROUGH THE THIRD DAY.
