JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 345 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH DUE TO AN M6 FLARE THAT
STARTED AT 2042Z, ATTAINED MAXIMUM AT 2052Z AND ENDED AT 2107Z.
THE EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WEAK DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. AN OP-
TICAL CORRELATION COULD NOT BE MADE UNAMBIGUOUSLY, SINCE REGIONS
6397 (N10W52), 6402 (S11W83), AND 6387 (S23W93) WERE ALL REPORT-
ED TO BE FLARING DURING THE EVENT. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARE AC-
TIVITY OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD: AN M1/SF FROM 6387 (S23W93)
AT 0508Z, AN M1/1N AT 1153Z AND AN M1/SF AT 1819Z FROM 6398
(N15W71). THE MATURE REGIONS IN THE NORTHWEST, 6395 (N19E55),
6397 (N10W52) AND 6398 (N15W71), APPEARED TO BE ON THE DECLINE,
ALTHOUGH THEY CERTAINLY PRODUCED NUMEROUS C-CLASS SUBFLARES IN
ADDITION TO THE EVENTS MENTIONED EARILIER. REGION 6402 (S11W83)
ALMOST DOUBLED IN SIZE TODAY, AND PRODUCED NUMEROUS C-CLASS
FLARES (THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS A C5). THE NORTHEAST PART OF
THE DISK WAS ALSO OF INTEREST TODAY WITH THREE MAJOR SPOTS NOW
VISIBLE AS FOLLOWS: A SMALL H-TYPE AT N24E66 ASSIGNED 6413, A
LARGE H-TYPE AT N20E75 ASSIGNED 6412 WHICH IS THE RETURN OF OLD
6368, AND ANOTHER LARGE H-TYPE SPOT NEAR N18E89. THE LATTER MAY
BE THE TRAILING PORTION OF OLD 6368 BUT ITS PROXIMITY TO THE
LIMB PREVENTED THIS DETERMINATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE MAIN THREATS FOR M-CLASS FLARES APPEAR TO BE RE-
GIONS 6398 AND 6397, ALTHOUGH 6410, 6412 OR 6402 MIGHT ALSO
CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY. THERE IS A SLIGHT-FAIR CHANCE FOR AN
ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE. A GRADUAL DOWNWARD TREND IN ACTIVITY
LEVELS IS ANTICIPATED WITH THE DEPARTURE OF 6387, 6402, AND
6398 OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET UNTIL SOMETIME MID TO LATE IN THE DAY TO-
MORROW. AN INCREASE IS EXPECTED AT THAT TIME, LASTING THROUGH
DAY 2 WITH MID-LATITUDES TO BE AT ACTIVE LEVELS AND HIGH LAT-
ITUDES TO BE AT MINOR STORM LEVELS. THE INCREASE IS EXPECTED
AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR SOLAR FLARE OF 10 DECEMBER, WITH
ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS POSSIBLE FROM A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE. ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO GENERALLY
UNSETTLED LEVELS BY DAY 3.
