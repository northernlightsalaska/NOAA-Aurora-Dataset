FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 070
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 11 MAR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY A FEW LOW LEVEL
C-CLASS FLARES WERE OBSERVED TODAY. MOST OF THESE WERE FROM
REGION 5969 (N31E51), APPARENTLY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF FILA-
MENT ACTIVITY AND MODEST GROWTH. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS
OBSERVED ON THE WEST LIMB AT N30 AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
LONG DURATION X-RAY EVENT (PEAK FLUX OF C3.2). THE REMAINDER OF
THE DISK AND LIMBS WERE ESSENTIALLY QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGIONS 5969 IS EXPECTED TO BE THE PRIMARY SOURCE FOR
CONTINUED LOW LEVEL C-CLASS FLARES. REGIONS 5964 (N29W55) AND
5965 (S10W51) MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED. SOME ISOLATED
PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TOMORROW, BECOMING GENERALLY ACTIVE
FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS. THE INCREASE IS EXPECTED DUE
TO RECURRENT EFFECTS. TODAY'S PROMINENCE ERUPTION MIGHT ALSO
CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY ON THE THIRD DAY.
