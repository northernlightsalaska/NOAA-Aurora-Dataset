JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 230 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6216 (N07W28)
PRODUCED AN M1/SF FLARE AT 17/2342Z AND A C9/SF FLARE AT
17/2259Z. SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OCCURRED IN THIS REGION DURING THE
PERIOD. THE SAME WAS TRUE OF REGION 6214 (S10E06) WHICH PRODUCED
SEVERAL SUBFLARES. REGION 6199 (N13W57) CONTINUED TO SLOWLY
DECAY, BUT REMAINED MODERATELY COMPLEX IN MAGNETIC ASPECTS. NEW
REGION 6226 (S22E72) ROTATED INTO VIEW DISPLAYING ACTIVE SURGING
AND SUBFLARE ACTIVITY. SURGING WAS ALSO OBSERVED FROM BEHIND
THIS REGION STRONGLY SUGGESTING THAT OLD REGION 6172 WILL BE
AN ACTIVE GROUP WHEN IT ROTATES INTO VIEW SOMETIME TOMORROW. A
LARGE FILAMENT DISAPPEARED SOMETIME NEAR 18/0000Z. IT WAS 30
DEGREES LONG AND CENTERED NEAR N38E03 WHEN LAST VIEWED AT THE
BOULDER OBSERVATORY. REGIONS 6224 (S34W13) AND 6225 (N21E43)
WERE ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES MAY OCCUR FROM REGIONS 6199
AND 6226.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE ACTIVE LEVELS OCCURRED EARLY IN
PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS. THE ACTIVE LEVELS
ARE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE LATE IN THE PERIOD IN RESPONSE TO THE
FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE MENTIONED ABOVE.
