JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 211 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 JUL 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  REGION 6180 (N18E30)
A MAGNETICALLY SIMPLE CAO GROUP, PRODUCED A LONG DURATION M4/2B
TENFLARE AT 0736Z.  TYPES II AND IV RADIO SWEEPS WERE ALSO
DETECTED AND THE ASSOCIATED SHOCK SPEED WAS ESTIMATED AT
1000 KM/SEC.  A NUMBER OF ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES WERE OBSERVED
ON THE SE LIMB TODAY, FROM ABOUT 20S - 80S, THE LARGEST EXTENDED
OUT TO APPROXIMATELY .26 SOLAR RADII.  NEW REGION 6184 (S08E34)
WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 6180 HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY
SINCE ITS EARLIER LDE AND MAY STILL POSSESS SOME POTENTIAL FOR
AN M-CLASS FLARE.  OTHER POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVITY COMES FROM
REGION 6162 (N12W78) AND THE GROUP OF THREE REGIONS 6172
(S23W16), 6174 (S11W13, AND 6177 (S19W05) WHOSE INTERACTION
MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS RANGED FROM QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.   ONE PERIOD OF MINOR STORMING WAS
OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY
IS EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED.  A SLIGHT INCREASE IN
ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE BY AUGUST 01 DUE TO TODAY'S LDE.
