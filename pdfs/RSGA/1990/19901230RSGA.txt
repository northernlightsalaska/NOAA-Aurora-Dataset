JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 364 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6424 (S11W48)
ERUPTED WITH THREE M-CLASS FLARES IN A FIVE HOUR SPAN: M1/0B
TENFLARE AT 1321Z, M4/1B AT 1516Z, AND M1/0N AT 1832Z. THESE
HOMOLOGOUS EVENTS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY VERY IMPULSIVE X RAY
BURSTS LACKING THE NORMAL GRADUAL DECAY PHASE, AND MODERATE
BURSTS AT RADIO FREQUENCIES ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. THE X RAY
PROFILE SUGGESTS A FLARE SITE IN THE CORONA AND LITTLE CHROMO-
SPHERIC HEATING. THIS REGION WAS ALSO THE SITE OF C-CLASS
FLARES, AMONG THEM A C5/0N TENFLARE AT 1148Z. ELSEWHERE LITTLE
OF SIGNIFICANCE OCCURRED. A NEW REGION, 6432 (S09E41), WAS
ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6424 SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINANT
ACTIVE REGION AND ADDITIONAL ENERGETIC ACTIVITY IS LIKELY.
2IA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD.
