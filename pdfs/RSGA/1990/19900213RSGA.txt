IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO CON-
SIST OF FREQUENT RADIO BURSTS AND SWEEPS AND OCCASIONAL C-CLASS
SUBFLARES. REGION 5927 (N18W02) CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE DISK

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE

REGION 5930 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
