SDF NUMBER 093
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 03 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. A NEW, HOT ACTIVE REGION
IS ROTATING ONTO THE DISK AT N28 (EAST LIMB) AND WAS ASSIGNED
SESC NUMBER 6007. THIS REGION PRODUCED TWO MAJOR FLARES DURING
THE PERIOD: AN M7 AT 0842Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOOPS OUT
TO .08 RADII, WITH WEAK RADIO BURSTS AT LOW FREQUENCIES AND
STRONG BURSTS AT HIGH FREQUENCIES, AND A STRONG TYPE IV SWEEP;
AND AN X1/1N AT 1726Z ASSOCIATED WITH BRIGHT SURGING ON THE
LIMB, MODERATE TO STRONG RADIO BURSTS (GENERALLY STRONGER AT
HIGHER FREQUENCIES) AND A MODERATE TYPE II SWEEP. THE REGION'S
LATITUDE SUGGESTS THAT IT IS IN THE VICINITY OF OLD REGION
5969. REGION 6001 (N21E23) CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE VISIBLE
DISK IN SIZE AND PRODUCED A FEW UPPER LEVEL C-CLASS EVENTS.
THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK WAS RELATIVELY STABLE AND QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. ADDITIONAL ISOLATED MAJOR FLARES ARE EXPECTED
FROM REGION 6007. REGION 6001 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE SOME M-LEVEL
FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD UNTIL ABOUT 1030UT WHEN CONDITIONS
BECAME UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT MID-LATITUDES AND GENERALLY
ACTIVE WITH SOME MINOR STORM PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
OCCASIONAL ACTIVE PERIODS ARE POSSIBLE AT HIGHER LATITUDES
DURING THE ENTIRE FORECAST PERIOD. A SLIGHT INCREASE IS
POSSIBLE ON DAY 2 IN RESPONSE TO THE LONG DURATION M4 EVENT
OF 01 APRIL.
