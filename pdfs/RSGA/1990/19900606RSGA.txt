JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 06 JUN 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. NEWLY ASSIGNED
REGION 6093 (S18W77) HAS GROWN RAPIDLY SINCE IT EMERGED
OVERNIGHT DISPLAYING FREQUENT BRIGHT SURGING AND PRODUCING
THE LARGEST EVENTS OF THE PERIOD: AN M1/SF FLARE AT
AT 06/1643Z AND AN M1/SN FLARE AT 06/2034Z. OCCASIONAL
C-CLASS SUBFLARES HAVE ALSO BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THIS
NEW FEATURE. REGION 6089 (N08E35) EXHIBITED NOTABLE
GROWTH WHILE PRODUCING OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES. AN ACTIVE
PROMINENCE ON THE NORTHEAST LIMB AND OCCASIONAL SURGING
TO THE SOUTH MAY SIGNAL THE RETURN OF OLD REGIONS 6063 AND

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6093 SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRODUCE
OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES WITH THE CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED

CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY LEVELS AS WELL AS OLD REGIONS 6063
(N34) AND 6064 (S14) WHICH ARE DUE TO RETURN 8 JUNE.
