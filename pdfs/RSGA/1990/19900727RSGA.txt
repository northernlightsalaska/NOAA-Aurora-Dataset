JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 208 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 JUL 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE
PERIOD WAS A C6/1N FLARE AT 27/0006Z FROM REGION 6162 (N10W39).
A C2/SF FLARE AT 26/2337Z WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THIS REGION
WHICH IS NOW SHOWING A STEADY DECLINE IN SPOT AREA WITH
SOME LOSS OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. REGION 6176 (S18W82)
PRODUCED THE ONLY OTHER X-RAY EVENT OF THE PERIOD: A C1/SF
FLARE AT 27/1521Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BRIGHT SURGING.
REGIONS 6172 (S25E24), 6174 (S13E26), AND 6177 (S21E32) HAVE
FORMED INTO A TRIAD OF STACKED AND ABUTTED SPOT GROUPS WHICH
HAVE SHOWN SOME GROWTH IN SPOT AREA AND COMPLEXITY. NEW
REGION 6180 (N17E64) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6162 CONTINUES TO POSE A REASONABLE THREAT
FOR ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENTS WITH THE CLUSTER OF REGIONS IN
THE SOUTHEAST (6174, 6177, AND 6172) PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL
SOURCE FOR ENHANCED C-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS STARTED OUT THE
PERIOD WITH THE FIELD DECAYING TO GENERALLY UNSETTLED
LEVELS THEREAFTER. THE SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON EVENT THAT
BEGAN 26/1720Z REACHED A PEAK OF 19 PFU AT 27/0500Z AND
SETTLED BELOW THE 10 PFU THRESHOLD AT 27/1520Z WITH THE
GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTONS STILL ENHANCED ABOVE BACKGROUND
LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE IN RESPONSE TO EFFECTS
FROM THE LONG DURATION EVENT THAT OCCURRED LATE ON 25 JULY.
THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTONS SHOULD CONTINUE TO DECLINE
TO BACKGROUND LEVELS.
