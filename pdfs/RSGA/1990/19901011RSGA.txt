JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 284 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. SIGNIFICANT GROWTH
WAS NOTED IN REGION 6312 (N09E32). INTERACTION BETWEEN THIS
REGION AND 6311 (N14E26) TO ITS NORTH MAY HAVE HELPED IN
PRODUCING THE M1/1N FLARE NOTED IN 6312 AT 11/0741Z.
OCCASIONAL C-CLASS EVENTS WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THIS
AREA THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. REGION 6314 (S18E40) REMAINED
GENERALLY STABLE. A MODEST SEGMENT OF FILAMENT LOCATED
NEAR S28W55 DISAPPEARED BETWEEN 11/0300-1354Z. WEAK
SURGING WAS NOTED ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB POSSIBLY SIGNALING
THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 6272 (S13, L103) WHICH PRODUCED
SEVERAL M-EVENTS DURING ITS LAST ROTATION. NEW REGIONS
6319 (S26E36) AND 6320 (N06W66) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. WHILE GENERALLY C-CLASS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
DOMINATE, REGION 6312 OR 6314 MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED
M-FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS
EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF MAJOR TO SEVERE STORMING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
