ISSUED 2200Z 06 MAR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. HOWEVER, C-CLASS SUBFLARES
WERE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS, LARGELY DUE
TO THE CONTRIBUTION OF REGION 5963 (S13W26). THIS SPOT GROUP
HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN BOTH WHITE LIGHT AND H-
ALPHA. IN ADDITION, REGIONS 5961 (N30W39) AND 5965 (S10E17) ALSO
PRODUCED OCCASIONAL LOW LEVEL ACTIVITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE PROSPECTS FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT ARE MUCH
IMPROVED OWING TO THE RESURGENCE OF REGION 5963.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT MID-
LATITUDES. SLIGHTLY MORE DISTURBED CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT
HIGH LATITUDES. THIS ACTIVITY IS RECURRENT IN NATURE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED. THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE
SHOULD END SOON.
