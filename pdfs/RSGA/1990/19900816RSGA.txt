TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6206 (S16E04)
PRODUCED THREE OF THE FIVE C-CLASS SUBFLARES OBSERVED DURING THE
PERIOD. REGION 6199 (N13W29) CONTINUED TO GROW SLOWLY DISPLAYING
INCREASED PENUMBRAE ON BOTH ITS LEAD AND TRAILER GROUPINGS. THE
REGION CONTINUED TO EXHIBIT MODERATE MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY, BUT
PRODUCED NO FLARES. NEW REGIONS 6218 (N22E06) AND 6219 (N13E67)
WERE NUMBERED.

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE HIGH LATITUDE FIELD VARIED
FROM UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM LEVELS. THE STORMING IS MOST
LIKELY IN RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED TRANSEQUATORIAL
CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS. THE ACTIVE
LEVELS SHOULD BEGIN TO SUBSIDE TOMORROW AS THE CORONAL HOLE
APPROACHES THE WEST LIMB. ACTIVE LEVELS MAY PERSIST INTO THE
SECOND DAY AT HIGH LATITUDES.
