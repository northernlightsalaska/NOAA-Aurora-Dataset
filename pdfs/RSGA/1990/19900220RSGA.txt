ISSUED 2200Z 20 FEB 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE PERIOD WAS PUNCTUATED
BY OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES, MOST OF WHICH CAME FROM REGION 5947
(S18E61). THIS REGION GREW GRADUALLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
REGION 5942 (S36E39) DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH, BUT PRODUCED
ONLY ISOLATED SUBFLARES. NEW REGIONS 5949 (N25W16) AND 5950

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 5942 AND 5947 ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES. THESE REGIONS ALSO PROVIDE A VERY
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.
