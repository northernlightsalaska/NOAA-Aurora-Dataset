JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 285 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. OCCASIONAL SUBFLARING
AND LOW LEVEL C-FLARES WERE THE EXTENT OF THE DAYS ACTIVITY.
REGION 6314 (S18E27) WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE C-CLASS EVENTS
WHILE REGIONS 6311 (N15E13) AND 6312 (N09E17) CONTRIBUTED
ISOLATED SUBFLARING. THESE REGIONS (6311 AND 6312) COMBINED
WITH REGION 6309 (N12E05) FORM A COMPACT CLUSTER OF SPOT
GROUPS IN THE NORTHEAST. 6311 HAS SHOWN SOME GROWTH WHILE
6312 AND 6309 HAVE REMAINED GENERALLY STABLE. WEAK SURGING
CONTINUED ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB WHERE MODERATELY STRONG
CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. NEW REGION 6321
(S24E63) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 6314 OR INTERACTION BETWEEN REGIONS
6311 AND 6312 MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED LOW LEVEL M-FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. PERIODS OF MAJOR STORMING
WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DAY ONE OF
THE PERIOD WITH GENERALLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS EXPECTED
THEREAFTER.
