SDF NUMBER 125
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 05 MAY 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY ONE WEAK CLASS C1
ENHANCEMENT WAS OBSERVED. REGION 6049 (N16E43) GREW SLOWLY AND
PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES AS DID REGION 6050 (S13E47). A
MODERATELY LARGE FILAMENT DISAPPEARED BETWEEN 04/2100Z AND
05/0300Z. IT WAS 22 DEGREES IN NORTH-SOUTH EXTENT, OF MODERATE
WIDTH, AND ITS CENTER WAS AT S21W22 AT 04/2100Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE AT A
LOW LEVEL FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. RETURNING REGIONS DUE
AT THE EAST LIMB ON LATE 08 AND 09 MAY COULD RAISE ACTIVITY
TO MODERATE LEVELS. HOWEVER, THESE LONGITUDES ARE EXPECTED
TO BE LESS ACTIVE THAN LAST ROTATION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF THE PERIOD BETWEEN 0900-1330Z WHEN ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WERE EXPERIENCED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE FORECAST

DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME, ON 07-08 MAY.
