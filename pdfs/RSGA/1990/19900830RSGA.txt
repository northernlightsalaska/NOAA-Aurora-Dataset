JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 242 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. MOST OF TODAY'S AC-
TIVITY WAS PRODUCED BY REGION 6233 (N13W16),  INCLUDING AN M1/SN
AT 0200Z (ALTHOUGH REGION 6223 (S12W83) WAS ALSO FLARING AT THE
SAME TIME), AN M1/SF AT 0452Z, AND AN M2/1B AT 1319Z. REGION
6233 CONTINUES TO BE A LARGE, MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX REGION BUT
IS NO LONGER GROWING. FOUR NEW REGIONS EMERGED ON THE DISK
TODAY. ALL OF THEM ARE STRUCTURALLY SIMPLE AND WERE RELATIVELY
QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
PREDOMINANTLY MODERATE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A FAIR POSSIBILITY
FOR HIGH LEVELS, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF REGION 6233.
REGIONS 6233, 6226 (S21W80), AND 6227 (S24W68) ARE THE MOST
LIKELY SOURCES FOR M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED EARLY IN THE
PERIOD UNTIL ABOUT 0300Z. SINCE THEN CONDITIONS HAVE RANGED
FROM ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS. THIS DISTURBANCE COULD BE
A RESPONSE TO EITHER THE X3 FLARE OF 27 AUGUST OR A FAVORABLY
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE WITH SOME BRIEF STORM PERIODS
FOR ABOUT 12 MORE HOURS AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE CONTINUES.
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE GRADUALLY TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
