JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 261 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 SEP 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6272 (S13E22)
PRODUCED AN IMPULSIVE M5/1B FLARE AT 17/2156Z. MODERATE TO
LARGE DISCRETE FREQUENCY BURSTS ACCOMPANIED THE FLARE WITH A
540 F.U. BURST OBSERVED AT 10CM.  A VIDEO SEQUENCE OF THE
EVENT INDICATED A BLAST WAVE PROPAGATED AWAY FROM THE FLARE
SITE.  OVERALL, THIS REGION IS IN SLOW DECAY WITH BASICALLY
A BIPOLAR STRUCTURE. NUMEROUS SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED FROM MANY
OTHER REGIONS.  ACTIVE SURGING WAS VISIBLE NEAR N13E90 - IN
A LOCATION WHERE PREVIOUSLY ACTIVE REGION 6233 IS DUE TO
RETURN.  AN H SPOT APPEARED AT S24E68 AND WAS NUMBERED AS
REGION 6278.  A SMALL GROWING CLASS D GROUP EMERGED AT
S08E47 AND BECAME REGION 6279.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BECOME
GENERALLY MODERATE.  REGION 6272 IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
ANOTHER LOW TO MID M-CLASS FLARE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.
THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 6233 TO THE NORTHEAST LIMB MAY
INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF CLASS M FLARES.  HOWEVER, THE LACK
OF ENERGETIC LIMB ACTIVITY AND THE RELATIVE STABILITY OF
FULL DISK INDICES ARGUE FOR A LESSER REGION AT THIS LOCATION
THIS ROTATION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD BEGAN THE PERIOD AT QUIET TO
UNSETTLED LEVELS.  ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS BEGAN
NEAR 18/0800Z AND CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD REMAIN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
MAJORITY OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE EFFECTS FROM THE M5
FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN LATE ON 19 SEP.
