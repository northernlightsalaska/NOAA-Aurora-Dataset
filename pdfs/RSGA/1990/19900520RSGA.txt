FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 140
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 20 MAY 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  THE LARGEST FLARE OF
THE PERIOD WAS AN M1/1N AT 0442Z FROM REGION 6064 (S16W26).  A
FILAMENT NEAR REGION 6060 (N22W60) WAS REPORTED TO ERUPT FROM
1311Z-1344Z.  MATERIAL WAS VISIBLE TO .17 SOLAR RADII.  AN
ASSOCIATED SLOW RISE IN X-RAYS WAS NOTED, CULMINATING WITH A
C5/SF AT 1335Z FROM REGION 6060.  A 310 SFU TENFLARE WAS
OBSERVED AT 1906Z AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN OPTICAL SF FROM
REGION 6063 (N35W32).  ALTHOUGH MOSTLY QUIET THROUGHOUT THE
REPORTING PERIOD, REGIONS 6063 AND 6064 REMAIN MAGNETICALLY
COMPLEX AND CAPABLE OF PRODUCING MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.
SLIGHT GROWTH AND INCREASED ACTIVITY WAS NOTED FROM REGION
6070 (S19E40), WHILE MOST OTHER REGIONS REMAINED QUIET TODAY.
NEW REGION 6073 (N11W31) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH.  REGIONS 6063 AND 6064 CONTINUE TO HAVE THE
BEST CHANCE OF PRODUCING MAJOR ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  SATELLITE LEVEL PROTONS ARE AT
BACKGROUND LEVELS AGAIN AFTER THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE PAST
FEW DAYS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.  MINOR EFFECTS FROM
TODAY'S DISAPPEARING FILAMENT ARE POSSIBLE TOWARDS THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
