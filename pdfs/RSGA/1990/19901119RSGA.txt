JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 323 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 19 NOV 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THERE WERE THREE
M-CLASS FLARES THE PAST 24 HOURS. ALTHOUGH ONLY THE LARGEST,
AN M3/1N AT 0954UT WAS OPTICALLY CORRELATED, IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL
THAT EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO CAME FROM SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN
REGION 6368 (N13W02). A DELTA CONFIGURATION REMAINS IN THE
TRAILER PORTION OF THE REGION, BUT MAGNETIC ANALYSIS SUGGESTS
THAT IT IS WEAKENING. ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTATION AND SLIGHT SIZE
REDUCTION TODAY MAY INDICATE THAT THE REGION HAS BEGUN ITS
DECAY PROCESS. NEW REGION 6376 (S18W19) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY MODERATE. THERE IS STILL A FAIR CHANCE OF A MAJOR FLARE,
HOWEVER, IT IS EXPECTED TO BE ISOLATED. IF A MAJOR FLARE WERE
TO OCCUR, IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT IT WOULD ORIGINATE IN THE
TRAILER PORTION OF THE REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. IT APPEARS THAT THE ACTIVITY
EXPECTED FROM THE CORONAL HOLE HAS FAILED TO MATERIALIZE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED THE FIRST DAY OF THE PERIOD.
QUIET TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD DOMINATE THE REMAINDER OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.
