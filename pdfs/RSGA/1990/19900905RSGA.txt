JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 248 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 05 SEP 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 04/2100Z
TO 05/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  REGION 6233
(N13W97) PRODUCED AN M2/SF FLARE AT 0431Z AS IT PASSED OVER
THE WEST LIMB.  OTHER ACTIVITY INCLUDED AN UNCORRELATED C8
FLARE AT 0035Z, TWO OTHER LOW LEVEL C-CLASS FLARES AND
SEVERAL SUBFLARES FROM REGION 6238 (S12W44).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW.  ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ON THE DISK, THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY OF REGION 6233 TO THE LIMB MAKES EFFECTS OF A LARGE
FLARE FROM IT A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
REGIONS 6246 (S14EO7) AND 6252 (N12E60) APPEAR TO HAVE THE BEST
POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE OF THE REGIONS
LEFT ON THE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 04/2100Z TO 05/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED THE PAST 24
HOURS.  A FEW PERIODS OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT
THE BEGINING OF THE PERIOD, PROBABLY IN RESPONSE TO A LARGE
FILAMENT WHICH DISAPPEARED SOMETIME AROUND 01/0900Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
