JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 340 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  ONLY SMALL C CLASS FLARES
WERE OBSERVED.  MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY HAS COME FROM REGION 6400
(S24W90) AND THE REGION 6395 (N17E11)/6397 (N10E18) COMPLEX.
REGION 6400 IS GROWING AND PRODUCING SMALL SURGES AS IT MAKES
ITS WEST LIMB TRANSIT.  INTERIOR SPOTS HAVE EMERGED IN
REGIONS 6395 AND 6397 AND A SMALL DELTA WAS REPORTED IN 6395.
A DELTA WAS ALSO REPORTED IN REGION 6387 (S23W26).  REGION
6404 (S18E25) EMERGED AND IS GROWING SLOWLY.  REGIONS 6405
(S11E58) AND 6406 (S24E57) WERE ASSIGNED, BOTH ARE SMALL SPOT
GROUPS IN SCATTERED PLAGE.  CORONAL HOLE 61, LOCATED IN THE
NORTH EAST, APPEARS TO EXTEND TO THE SOLAR NORTH POLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  THE MOST LIKELY SOURCES FOR ACTIVITY ARE THE
6395/6397 COMPLEX, REGION 6387, AND THE SOUTH WEST LIMB AREA.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS.  SOME ACTIVE PERIODS WERE OBSERVED AROUND
06/1100UT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN GENERALLY UNSETTLED.  A SLIGHT INCREASE IS
EXPECTED LATE IN THE PERIOD FROM A FAVORABLY LOCATED CORONAL
HOLE.
