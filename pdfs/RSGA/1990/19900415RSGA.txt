FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 105
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 15 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6022 (N32E39)
PRODUCED AN X1/2B FLARE AT 15/0302Z. THE FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY MAJOR RADIO BURSTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM INCLUDING AN 11000
SFU TENFLARE AND TYPES II AND IV SWEEPS. A LOOP PROMINENCE
SYSTEM WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLARE. THIS REGION CONTINUED
TO DISPLAY SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN MAGNETIC AND WHITE LIGHT
ASPECTS. REGION 6018 (S33E16) DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AS
WELL PRODUCING SEVERAL FLARES INCLUDING AN M1/SF AT 15/1158Z.
REGION 6021 (S15E44) ALSO GREW SIGNIFICANTLY PRODUCING ISOLATED
SUBFLARES. NEW REGIONS 6026 (N11W05) AND 6027 (N13E08), BOTH
NONDESCRIPT BIPOLES, WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 6022 IS EASILY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
ADDITIONAL MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. REGIONS 6018 AND 6021 MAY
EACH PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE. BOTH REGIONS ALSO
PROVIDE A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ISOLATED INTERVALS OF MINOR STORMING
OCCURRED AT MIDDLE AND HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS TOMORROW
INCREASING TO ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE BALANCE OF
THE PERIOD. TODAY'S MAJOR FLARE MAY BEGIN TO AFFECT THE FIELD
ON THE 17TH. AN ISOLATED NORTHERN HEMISPHERE CORONAL HOLE,
PRESENTLY STRADDLING CENTRAL MERIDIAN, WILL BE IN A POSITION
TO BEGIN AFFECTING THE FIELD ON 18 APRIL. A SATELLITE LEVEL
PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV MAY OCCUR FROM TODAY'S
MAJOR FLARE.
