OCCURRED AT 16/0824Z. THE BURST WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A BRIGHT
SURGE TO 0.16RV AT S18E90. THIS ACTIVITY MAY HERALD THE RETURN
OF OLD REGION 5852 WHICH PRODUCED SEVERAL MAJOR FLARES DURING
ITS LAST TRANSIT. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.

LOW TO MODERATE. MOSTLY C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED. AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE MAY OCCUR FROM REGION 5882 (N22E14) AND
FROM THE SOUTHEAST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE
HIGH LATITUDE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. THE
ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO A FILAMENT WHICH
DISAPPEARED ON 15 JANUARY.
