JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 344 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6398 (N15W57) PRO-
DUCED AN M5/2B FLARE (TODAY'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE) AT 0754Z WHICH
WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG TYPE II SWEEP (SHOCK VELOCITY 1400
KM/S), A STRONG TYPE IV SWEEP AND WEAK DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS.
THIS RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP (180 MILLIONTHS) PRODUCED THE
MAJORITY OF TODAY'S FLARE ACTIVITY, APPARENTLY DUE TO ITS
COMPLEX MAGNETIC INVERSION LINE. THE REMAINDER OF TODAY'S
ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF FREQUENT C-CLASS SUBFLARES FROM A NUMBER
OF REGIONS. REGIONS 6397 (N09W34) AND 6310 (N05E58) ARE CURRENT-
LY THE LARGEST GROUPS ON THE DISK BUT HAVE BEEN WERE FAIRLY
STABLE. OLD REGION 6368 RETURNED TODAY AS AN H-TYPE SPOT (SO
FAR) WITH INTENSITY 1-2 PLAGE AND WAS ASSIGNED 6412 (N19E80).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH THE PRIMARY THREAT FOR M-CLASS FLARES FROM
REGIONS 6397 AND 6398. REGION 6410 (N05E58), WHICH PRODUCED
AN M2 FLARE YESTERDAY IS ALSO A POSSIBLE SOURCE FOR M-CLASS
FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TOMORROW AND FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE
SECOND DAY. AN INCREASE IS EXPECTED DURING THE LATTER PART
OF THE SECOND DAY AND LASTING THROUGH THE THIRD DAY IN RE-
SPONSE TO TODAY'S M5 SOLAR FLARE. THE LEVEL OF DISTURBANCE IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE LEVELS AT MID-LATITUDES AND MINOR
STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES. EFFECTS FROM A FAVORABLY
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY ON
THE THIRD DAY.
