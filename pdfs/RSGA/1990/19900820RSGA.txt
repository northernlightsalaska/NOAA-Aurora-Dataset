JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 232 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. FREQUENT SUB-
FLARES HAVE BEEN NOTED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD HOWEVER
NONE HAVE GENERATED ANY SIGNIFICANT X-RAY ENHANCEMENTS.
REGION 6214 (S11W21) DISPLAYED RAPID GROWTH IN SPOT AREA
ALONG WITH SIGNS OF INCREASED MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. A COMMON
NEUTRAL LINE JOINS REGIONS 6223 (S14E48) AND 6226 (S22E52)
WHICH HAVE BOTH SHOWN GROWTH IN AREA. REGION 6199 (N12W85)
CONTINUED TO DECAY. IMPRESSIVE EVENT LEVEL BRIGHT SURGING
WAS OBSERVED FROM REGION 6220 (S18W62) AT 20/1818Z. NEW
REGION 6228 (S06E74) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. INTERACTION BETWEEN REGIONS 6223 AND 6226 MAY
ASSIST IN PRODUCING AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE. ISOLATED
ACTIVITY IS ALSO POSSIBLE FROM REGION 6214.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE ACTIVE TO MINOR STORMING
MAY BE IN RESPONSE TO EFFECTS FROM A LARGE SOLAR FILAMENT
THAT DISAPPEARED ON 18 AUGUST.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE LEVELS AT THE START OF THE PERIOD
WITH UNSETTLED CONDITIONS EXPECTED THEREAFTER.
