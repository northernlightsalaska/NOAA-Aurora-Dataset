JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 346 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  THERE WERE A TOTAL OF
EIGHT M-CLASS FLARES. THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS AN M8/SF AT
1410UT FROM REGION 6398 (N15W83). EARLIER A MAJOR FLARE ERUPTED
FROM REGION 6399 (N21W82), THIS FLARE WAS AN M5/SF AT 0803UT.
REGION 6399 WAS THE TODAY'S BIGGEST PRODUCER, WITH FIVE M-CLASS
FLARES DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 6410 (N05E32) DISPLAYED
SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH AND INCREASED ACTIVITY TODAY. THE REGION ON
THE NORTHEAST LIMB AT N18 YESTERDAY, WAS COMBINED WITH REGION
6412 (N17E66) AS THE TRAILER PORTION OF THE REGION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6398, 6399, 6410 AND 6412 ARE MOST
LIKELY TO PRODUCE THE MODERATE ACTIVITY. ANY OF THESE REGIONS
ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ALSO. THE
GENERAL TREND OF ACTIVITY SHOULD BE ON THE DECLINE AS THE GROUP
OF REGIONS IN THE NORTHEAST ROTATES OFF THE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE FIRST DAY IN RESPONSE
TO THE SOLAR ACTIVITY OF 10 DECEMBER. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS
