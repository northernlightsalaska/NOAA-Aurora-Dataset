JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 17 FEB 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE LARGEST EVENTS WERE
SMALL C FLARES, ONE A C1.2 AT 0734UT, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DSF
AT N50W30.  SEVERAL SMALL REGIONS ARE ROTATING OVER THE SOUTH-
EAST LIMB ACCOMPANIED BY SURGE ACTIVITY.  ALL REGIONS APPEAR
STABLE OR DECLINING.  PROMINENCES NEAR NW40 AND SE35 HAVE BEEN
ACTIVE.  A LARGE EAST-WEST ORIENTATED CORONAL HOLE IS CENTERED
NEAR N22E10.  THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE FOR A CORONAL HOLE NEAR
THIS LOCATION SINCE 0CTOBER 1989.  THERE MAY BE ANOTHER CORONAL
HOLE CENTERED NEAR N20E55.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR INCREASED ACTIVITY FROM THE
RETURNING REGIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN GENERALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  SOME STORM PERIODS WERE OBSERVED,
HOWEVER, THE DISTURBANCE NOW APPEARS TO BE ENDING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE EARLY IN THE PERIOD.  THERE
IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE FIELD WILL AGAIN BE DISTURBED LATE
IN THE PERIOD AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE CORONAL HOLE AND DSF
ACTIVITY REPORTED IN IA.
