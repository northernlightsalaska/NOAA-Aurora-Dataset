JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 223 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  ONLY A FEW C CLASS
FLARES WERE OBSERVED SINCE YESTERDAY'S M7/2B IN REGION 6203
(N18E57).  THIS REGION IS NOW CLEARLY IN VIEW AND DOES
POSSESS SOME COMPLEXITY.  MAGNETICALLY, IT IS REVERSE POLARITY,
WITH THE LARGEST SPOT TO THE WEST A FOLLOWER POLARITY SPOT AND
THE TWO LARGE SPOTS TO THE EAST LEADER POLARITY SPOTS.
FURTHERMORE, ITS APPEARANCE IN H-ALPHA SUGGESTS THAT THIS GROUP
MAY MORE ACCURATELY BE VIEWED AS A SMALLER REVERSE POLARITY
SUNSPOT GROUP TO THE WEST, ABUTTED AGAINST A SINGLE UNIPOLAR
SPOT TO THE EAST.  THIS CONFIGURATION MAY HELP EXPLAIN THE
OCCURRANCE OF THE M7/2B FLARE YESTERDAY.  REGION 6197 (N14E25)
HAS SIMPLIFIED SOMEWHAT OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS AND HAS ONLY
PRODUCED A FEW SUBFLARES.  NEW REGIONS NUMBERED TODAY INCLUDE
6206 (S14E68), 6207 (S06W58), 6208 (N03E54), AND 6209 (N23E83).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  M CLASS FLARES ARE POSSIBLE IN REGIONS 6197
AND 6203.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE
LATITUDE STATIONS AND QUIET TO ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.  ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS
ARE POSSIBLE AT HIGH LATITUDES.
