JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 25 FEB 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 5947 (S16W04)
PRODUCED TWO LOW LEVEL C-FLARES. THIS REGION CONTINUES TO
BE MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX BUT IS BEGINNING TO DECAY WITH
FRAGMENTATION IN ITS SPOT STRUCTURE NOTED. REGION 5948
(N16W00) HAS REMAINED GENERALLY STABLE WITH ONLY SLIGHT DECAY
NOTED. REGION 5953 (S09E20) PRODUCED TWO C-CLASS EVENTS
AND SEVERAL SUBFLARES. A C3/SF AT 25/0745Z FROM REGION
5946 (N04W62) WAS THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE PERIOD. NO NEW
REGIONS WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5947 WITH ITS COMPLEX MAGNETIC STRUCTURE
REMAINS THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY WITH
ISOLATED MAJOR EVENTS POSSIBLE. REGION 5948 MAY ALSO
CONTRIBUTE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS, POSSIBLY DUE TO EFFECTS
FROM A CORONAL HOLE. PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING WERE
OBSERVED AT HIGHER LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
