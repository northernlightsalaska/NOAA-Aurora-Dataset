JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 317 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 NOV 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO AN IMPULSIVE
M1/SN PRODUCED BY REGION 6361 (N07W22) AT 0445Z. THE EVENT WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS. THE REGION PRODUCED
ADDITIONAL C-CLASS FLARES AND IS STILL MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX BUT
APPEARS TO BE SLOWLY DECAYING. THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK IS
NOW REGION 6368 (N20E70), CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO BE A 670 MIL-
LIONTHS D-TYPE GROUP, ALTHOUGH MORE PLAGE AND SPOTS APPEAR TO
BE ROTATING INTO VIEW. THE GROUP DID NOT PRODUCE ANY FLARES.
ADDITIONAL C-CLASS FLARES WERE PRODUCED BY A VARIETY OF REGIONS,
NOTABLY A C7/1F FROM 6358 AT 1133Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE COMBINED PROBABILITIES OF M-CLASS LEVEL ACTIVITY
FROM REGIONS 6361, 6358, 6364 AND 6368 PROVIDE A FAIR CHANCE
FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
