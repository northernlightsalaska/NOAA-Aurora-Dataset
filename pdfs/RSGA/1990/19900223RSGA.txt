IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5947 (S15E23)
INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY MAINTAINING A WEAK
DELTA CONFIGURATION WITHIN ITS CENTRAL PENUMBRAL STRUCTURE. IT
PRODUCED AN M2/2B FLARE AT 23/1259Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A
LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM, A SMALL FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE, AND
MINOR DISCRETE RADIO EMISSIONS. REGION 5953 (S09E47) PRODUCED AN
M1/SN FLARE AT 23/1635Z. REGION 5948 (N19E28) DISPLAYED
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN AREAL AND MAGNETIC ASPECTS, BUT WAS FAIRLY
STABLE DURING THE PERIOD. NEW REGIONS 5955 (S17E46) AND 5956
(N21E03) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5947 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE OCCASIONAL M-CLASS
FLARES. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY FROM
THIS REGION AS WELL. REGION 5948 IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE HIGH LATITUDE FIELD REACHED
MAJOR STORM LEVELS FROM 23/1200-1800Z. THE CAUSE OF THE
STORMING MAY HAVE BEEN A LARGE FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE WHICH
OCCURRED ON LATE 19 FEBRUARY/EARLY 20 FEBRUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE IN RESPONSE TO THE CONTINUING EFFECTS OF
THE FILAMENT MENTIONED ABOVE COMBINED WITH POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF
A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
