FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 045
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 14 FEB 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 5930 (N12W41) PRO-
DUCED TWO UPPER LEVEL C-CLASS FLARES TODAY: A C5/SF AT 1254Z AND
A C6/1F AT 1745Z. THIS GROUP APPEARS TO BE IN A NEW GROWTH PHASE
AS NEW SPOTS AND SIGNIFICANT PENUMBRAL GROWTH WERE NOTED. REGION
5927 (N17W15), STILL THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK, COULD ONLY
PRODUCE A SINGLE SUBFLARE, AND APPEARS TO BE ENTERING A GRADUAL
DECAY PHASE AT THIS TIME. THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK WAS QUIET
AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THE PRINCIPAL THREATS FOR FLARES ARE REGIONS 5930 AND 5927.
THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MODERATE LEVELS. AN INCREASE IN
BACKGROUND LEVELS IS EXPECTED ON THE THIRD DAY AS THE LONGITUDES
ASSOCIATED WITH OLD REGION 5900 (S10, L-339) WILL BE RETURNING
AT THAT TIME. OLD REGION 5900 WAS THE ONLY REGION TO PRODUCE A
A MAJOR FLARE IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
LEVELS WERE GENERALLY UNSETTLED UNTIL A SUDDEN IMPULSE
OCCURRED AT 0320Z. THE IMPULSE WAS FOLLOWED BY ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM CONDITIONS UNTIL ABOUT 1200Z, AFTER WHICH
LEVELS RETURNED TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS. THE ACTIVITY
WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY FILAMENTS WHICH DISAPPEARED ON 10
FEBRUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
