ISSUED 2200Z 14 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6018 (S33E29)
PRODUCED AN M4/1B FLARE AT 13/2127Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
MINOR RADIO EMISSIONS. THE REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/SN AT
14/0355Z AND AN M1/SN AT 14/1231Z. PLAGE REGION 6007 (N22W53),
A FORMER MAJOR FLARE PRODUCER, SHOWED IT STILL HAD SOME LIFE BY
PRODUCING A C9/SF FLARE AT 14/0241Z. REGION 6022 (N29E53)
CONTINUED TO GROW IN SIZE AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. IT PRODUCED
NUMEROUS SUBFLARES DURING THE PERIOD. REGION 6021 (S15E57) ALSO
GREW AND PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES. A WEAK, OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED TYPE IV SWEEP OCCURRED AT 14/0412Z. AN ERUPTIVE

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6018, 6021, AND 6022 ARE CAPABLE OF M-CLASS
FLARE PRODUCTION. REGIONS 6018 AND 6022 ALSO PROVIDE A SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. THE HIGH LATITUDE FIELD RANGED FROM ACTIVE TO MAJOR
STORM LEVELS. THE CAUSE OF THE STORMING REMAINS A MYSTERY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT MIDDLE
LATITUDES AND AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS AT HIGHER
LATITUDES.
