JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 338 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6397 (N09E44)
PRODUCED AN M6/1F FLARE AT 04/0203Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
A 310 SFU TENFLARE. THERE WERE NO RADIO SWEEP BURSTS OR MAJOR
DISCRETE FREQUENCY BURSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FLARE. THUS FAR,
THIS REGION HAS DISPLAYED NO SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND THE OBSERVED
MAGNETIC GRADIENTS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS GENERALLY WEAK.
REGION 6397 ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/1B FLARE AT 04/1439, ALSO
ACCOMPANIED BY MINOR DISCRETE RADIO EMISSIONS. REGION 6400
(S24W62) BEGAN PRODUCING FREQUENT SUBFLARES LATE IN THE PERIOD,
NONE OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT X-RAY BURSTS. NEW
REGION 6403 (S25E14) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6397 MAY PRODUCE ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES.
THIS REGION ALSO PROVIDES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED MAJOR
FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WERE
OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM 04/1200-1800Z. THE CAUSE OF
THE ACTIVITY IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS. ACTIVE LEVELS
MAY OCCUR DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF A
FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
