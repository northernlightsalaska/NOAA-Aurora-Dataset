IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5961 (N30E38)
CONTINUED TO GROW RAPIDLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD INCREASING
IN SPOT AREA AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. AS A RESULT, THE REGION
PRODUCED FOUR M-LEVEL EVENTS. AN M1/1F AT 27/2338Z AND AN M2/SF
AT 28/0522Z. THE LAST TWO M-CLASS EVENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH
THE SAME LONG DURATION OPTICAL FLARE. THE FIRST M1 PEAK WAS
AT 28/1548Z AND THE SECOND AT 28/1818Z. THE OPTICAL LEVEL
OF THE FLARE WAS 2N. THIS REGION ALSO PRODUCED A C3/2F FLARE
AT 28/1013Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LOOP PROMINENCE SYSTEM.
REGION 5947 (S16W42) CONTINUED TO DECLINE PRODUCING ONLY
OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES. REGION 5960 (N12E15) CONTINUED TO GROW IN
SPOT AREA. SURGING WAS NOTED PERIODICALLY ON THE NORTHEAST LIMB.
NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE WITH THE TREND TOWARDS HIGH LEVELS THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD. REGION 5961 HAS GOOD POTENTIAL FOR CONTINUED
M-CLASS EVENTS WITH ISOLATED MAJOR FLARES POSSIBLE. REGION 5947
MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
AT MIDDLE LATITUDES WITH A SHORT PERIOD OF MINOR STORMING
OBSERVED AT HIGHER LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. HIGH LATITUDES
MAY EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING.
