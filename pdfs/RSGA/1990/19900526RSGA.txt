FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 146
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 26 MAY 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  AN OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED X1 FLARE OCCURRED AT 26/2058Z.  THIS FLARE WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH A DISCRETE RADIO BURST OF 1200 SFU AT 2695 MHZ
AND A STRONG TYPE IV SWEEP.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO OPTICAL
FLARE OBSERVED, THE SOURCE IS MOST LIKELY REGION 6063 (NW34),
NOW A DAY BEHIND THE WEST LIMB.  REGION 6077 (N20E55)
CONTINUED TO GENERATE FLARES, THE LARGEST BEING AN M2/1B AT
26/1800Z.  THIS REGION HAS GROWN SOMEWHAT OVER THE PAST 24
HOURS AND APPEARS TO POSSESS MODERATE MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
THE REMAINING DISK REGIONS WERE RELATIVELY QUIET.  NEW REGION
6079 (S25E75) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 6077 IS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF
M CLASS ACTIVITY.  REGION 6063 IS EXPECTED TO ROTATE OUT
OF OUR RANGE OF INFLUENCE BEFORE IT CAN GENERATE FURTHER MAJOR
ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.  A SUDDEN
IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED AT MIDDLE LATITUDE STATIONS (41 NANOTESLA
AT BOULDER) AT 26/2025Z.  THIS IS THOUGHT TO BE THE RESULT OF
THE X9/1B FLARE OF 24 MAY.  THE PROTON EVENT CONTINUES IN
PROGRESS.  THE PROTON FLUX AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV SURPASSED THE
10 PFU EVENT THRESHOLD AT 24/2125Z AND REACHED A PRELIMINARY
PEAK FLUX OF 180 PFU AT 25/0115Z.  SO FAR, THE PEAK FLUX AT
GREATER THAN 50 MEV AND 100 MEV WAS 41 PFU AT 24/2200Z AND
19 PFU AT 24/2155Z, RESPECTIVELY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS,
AND ACTIVE TO UNSETTLED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.
