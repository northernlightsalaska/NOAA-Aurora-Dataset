FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 055
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 24 FEB 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5953 (S09E33)
PRODUCED THE PERIOD'S ONLY M-CLASS FLARE: AN M1/SF AT 24/0321Z.
THIS REGION DISPLAYED GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. THE SAME WAS
TRUE OF REGIONS 5948 (N16E13) AND 5955 (S17E59). REGION 5948
WAS THE MOST ACTIVE GROUP PRODUCING SEVERAL SMALL FLARES
INCLUDING A C9/1N AT 23/2351Z. REGION 5947 (S16E09) WAS
RELATIVELY QUIET DESPITE ITS MODERATELY COMPLEX MAGNETIC
STRUCTURE. NEW REGIONS 5957 (S22E24) AND 5958 (S20E83) WERE
NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5947 IS THE PRINCIPAL THREAT FOR M-CLASS
FLARING BY VIRTUE OF ITS MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. IT ALSO DISPLAYS
POTENTIAL FOR ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY. REGION 5948 MAY
PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HIGHER LATITUDES EXPERIENCED SOME
PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A
FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE DECLINING TO UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE
FINAL DAY OF THE PERIOD. THE ACTIVE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED IN
RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
