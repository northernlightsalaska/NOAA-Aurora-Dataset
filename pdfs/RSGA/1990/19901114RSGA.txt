IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6366 (S22W09) PRO-
DUCED TODAY'S LARGEST EVENT: AN C3/SF AT 0929Z. THE GROUP HAS
GROWN RAPIDLY FROM YESTERDAY'S SIMPLE B-TYPE CONFIGURATION INTO
A SMALL D-TYPE GROUP WITH A SMALL DELTA CONFIGURATION AND BRIGHT
PLAGE. REGION 6368 (N18E63) HAS ROTATED INTO VIEW AS A VERY
LARGE FKI GROUP (1300 MILLIONTHS) AND PRODUCED SEVERAL C-CLASS
SUBFLARES DURING THE PERIOD. THE GROUP APPEARS TO BE HAVE A
SIMPLE NORTH-SOUTH INVERSION LINE WITH AN EAST-WEST KINK BETWEEN
SOME SMALL CENTRAL SPOTS. A 19 DEGREE FILAMENT LOCATED NEAR
N21E25 DISAPPEARED SOMETIME BETWEEN 1810Z AND 2154Z YESTERDAY
(13 NOVEMBER). REGION 6361 (N09W35) CONTINUES DECAY GRADUALLY,
PRODUCING OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE PRIMARY THREATS FOR M-CLASS FLARES ARE REGIONS
6366 AND 6368, WITH A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY ALSO FROM 6361. THERE
IS A POSSIBILITY FOR A MAJOR FLARE FROM REGION 6368 IF SOME KIND
OF TRIGGER MECHANISM CAN DEVELOP IN THE GROUP.
