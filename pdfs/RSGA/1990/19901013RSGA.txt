SDF NUMBER 286 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. C-CLASS SUBFLARES WERE
OBSERVED IN EIGHT DIFFERENT REGIONS WITH REGION 6314 (S18E13)
THE MOST ACTIVE. A 10 DEGREE-LONG FILAMENT DISAPPEARED FROM
S47E18 EARLY IN THE INTERVAL. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED,
6322 (S07E62) AND 6323 (N20E30).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGIONS 6314 AND 6312 (N10E05) EACH ARE
CAPABLE OF AN ISOLATED LOW-LEVEL CLASS M FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT 24 HOURS DUE TO
THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF DISAPPEARING FILAMENTS ON 10-11
OCTOBER. STRICTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS ARE LIKELY THE LAST 2
DAYS.
