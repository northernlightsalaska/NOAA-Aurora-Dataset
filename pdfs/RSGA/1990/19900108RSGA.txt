JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 08 JAN 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DURING THE PAST 24
HOURS.  REGION 5874 (S15E18) PRODUCED AN M1/1N LONG-DURATION
FLARE THAT MAXED AT 1314 UT, AS WELL AS TWO OTHER SMALL C-CLASS
X-RAY FLARES. REGION 5874 IS MODERATELY MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX
BUT HAS REMAINED STABLE IN WHITE LIGHT SINCE YESTERDAY.
NEW REGION 5878 ROTATED OVER THE EAST LIMB AS A SIMPLE H-TYPE
SPOT. IT IS THE RETURN OF OLD REGION 5836, AND ITS EAST LIMB
PASSAGE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MINOR SURGING.  TWO FILAMENT
DISAPPEARANCES WERE OBSERVED - ONE IN THE NORTHEAST AND
ANOTHER IN THE SOUTHWEST.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE BASED SOLELY ON THE FLARE POTENTIAL IN REGION 5874.

TIME THE MAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS AT BOTH MIDDLE AND HIGH LATITUDES. THE SOURCE OF THIS
DISTURBANCE IS UNIDENTIFIED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THROUGH MIDDAY ON 9 JAN,
