FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 035
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 04 FEB 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY TWO UNCORRELATED
LOW LEVEL C-CLASS EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. REGION 5920 (N15W25)
PRODUCED SEVERAL SUB FLARES ACCOMPANIED BY WEAK RADIO
EMISSIONS. THIS REGION REMAINS THE MOST COMPLEX ON THE DISK
FOR NOW BUT IS BEGINNING TO SHOW DECAY IN ITS LEADING SPOT
STRUCTURE. REGION 5923 (N05W81) PRODUCED A SINGLE SUB FLARE.
A BRIGHT SURGE ON THE LIMB WAS OBSERVED TO .22 RADII FROM
PREVIOUS REGION 5900 (S12W98). REGIONS 5919 (N08W21) AND
5913 (N14W73) HAVE REMAINED GENERALLY STABLE. REGION 5924
(N20W61) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. OCCASIONAL C-CLASS FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS
5913, 5919, AND 5920. REGION 5920 ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL
FOR VERY ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 27 NANOTESLAS
WAS OBSERVED AT 04/1652Z. THE ENHANCED ACTIVITY IS MOST
LIKELY DUE TO EFFECTS FROM A FLARE OBSERVED ON 3 FEBRUARY
AND A WEAK CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT MID LATITUDES WITH
MINOR STORM LEVELS EXPECTED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
