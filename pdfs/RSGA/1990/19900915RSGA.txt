JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 258 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 SEP 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGIONS 6268 (N22E27)
AND 6267 (S12E22) EACH DISPLAYED MINOR GROWTH AND SLIGHT
ELONGATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SPOT GROUPS WITH ISOLATED
SUBFLARING OBSERVED. A C2/SF FLARE WAS NOTED AT 15/0558Z
FROM REGION (S12E58) WHICH HAS ROTATED COMPLETELY INTO VIEW
NOW. REGION 6257 (S11W09) PRODUCED A C6/1N FLARE AT 15/0754Z.
REGION 6263 (N10E12) DISPLAYED MINOR GROWTH. A C2/SF FLARE
WITH STRONG RADIO EMISSIONS AT 245MHZ WAS OBSERVED HERE AT
15/0430Z. FREQUENT SURGING CONTINUES ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB
AS A LARGE PLAGE FIELD ROTATES INTO VIEW. NEW REGION 6275
(S24E67) IS A SMALL SPOT AREA THAT HAS JUST EMERGED IN THIS
AREA AND IS A LIKELY SOURCE FOR THE C7/SF FLARE THAT OCCURRED
THERE AT 15/0813Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. THE THREAT OF ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY
FROM EASTERN HEMISPHERE REGIONS PERSISTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. MINOR STORMING WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN 0900-1500Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD.
