FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 159
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 08 JUN 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. OCCASIONAL C-CLASS
SUBFLARING CHARACTERIZED THE PERIOD. REGION 6093 (S19, L136)
DEPARTED THE DISK EARLY IN THE PERIOD AFTER DISPLAYING AN
ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE AT 08/0226Z. REGION 6089 (N09E08)
PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES TO INCLUDE A C5/SF FLARE AT
08/1537Z. CONTINUED GROWTH IN SPOT AREA AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY
WERE NOTED. NEWLY ASSIGNED REGION 6100 (S13E73) ROTATED INTO
VIEW TODAY WITH A LARGE UNIPOLAR SPOT AREA VISIBLE SO FAR. THIS
AREA IS RETURNING OLD REGION 6064 WHICH PRODUCED NUMEROUS
M-CLASS EVENTS DURING ITS LAST TRANSIT. REGIONS 6097 (S09E17),
6098 (S12E54), AND 6099 (S19E59) WERE ALSO ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. OCCASIONAL SUBFLARING IS EXPECTED FROM
REGION 6089. THIS AREA ALSO SHOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR ISOLATED
M-CLASS ACTIVITY. REGION 6100 WAS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THE
UNCORRELATED M4 X-RAY EVENT NOTED 07/1930Z AND MAY
CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ACTIVITY LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE
FORECAST PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES WITH
A BRIEF PERIOD OF MINOR STORMING NOTED AT HIGH LATITUDES
BETWEEN 08/0900-1200Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
