JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 241 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6233 (N12W03)
CONTINUES TO BE THE DOMINANT REGION ON THE DISK, PRODUCING THREE
M-FLARES: M1/1N AT 28/2238Z, M1/SF AT 0819Z & M1/1N AT 2040Z, AS
WELL AS NUMEROUS SMALL SUBFLARES. THE REGION CONTINUES TO GROW
AND IS MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX, SHOWING A BETA-GAMMA-DELTA CONFIG-
URATION WITH TWO INVERSION LINE CROSSINGS IN THE LARGE TRAILER
SPOT. REGION 6226 (S21W63) PRODUCED MOST OF THE REMAINDER OF
TODAY'S ACTIVITY, WITH AN M1/1F AT 0433Z AND NUMEROUS SMALL
SUBFLARES. THIS REGION APPEARS TO BE GRADUALLY DECLINING AS
IT APPROACHES THE WEST LIMB. SURGING WAS OBSERVED ON EAST LIMB
AT S12.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
PREDOMINANTLY MODERATE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A FAIR POSSIBILITY
FOR HIGH LEVELS, HOWEVER, GIVEN THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF
REGION 6223. REGIONS 6223 AND 6226 ARE EXPECTED TO BE THE
MAIN SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED AT 1121Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR STORM LEVELS TOMORROW IN RESPONSE TO
THE X3 FLARE OF 27 AUGUST. EFFECTS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE DUE TO
A CORONAL HOLE WHICH WILL BE FAVORABLY POSITIONED ON THE SAME
DAY. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY SUBSIDE FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
