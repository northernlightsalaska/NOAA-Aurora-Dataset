FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 084
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 25 MAR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5988
(S06W00) PRODUCED OCCASIONAL LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS FLARES. THIS
REGION REMAINED MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX WITH ONLY MINOR GROWTH
NOTED. REGIONS 5974 (S33W69) AND 5983 (S32W17) WERE GENERALLY
QUIET. REGION 5984 (S12W30) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH
AND COMPLEXITY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IT WAS THE SOURCE OF
MOST OF THE DAY'S ACTIVITY TO INCLUDE TWO M-CLASS EVENTS:
AN M1/SF FLARE AT 25/1122Z AND AN M2/1B FLARE AT 25/1954Z.
NUMEROUS C-CLASS EVENTS WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THIS REGION.
THE REMAINING REGIONS WERE GENERALLY STABLE. REGION 5996
(S12E77) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 5988, 5984, AND 5974 ARE THE MOST
FAVORABLE SOURCES FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY. THESE REGIONS ARE
ALSO THE BEST CANDIDATES FOR ISOLATED MAJOR FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS WITH THE INCREASE IN ACTIVITY
MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNING CORONAL HOLES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MODERATELY ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD.
