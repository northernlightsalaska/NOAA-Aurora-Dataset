JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 225 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE.  TWO M CLASS FLARES
WERE OBSERVED SINCE YESTERDAY, AN M1/1F AT 13/0925Z IN
REGION 6199 (N12E11) AND AN M1/1B AT 13/1337Z JUST TO THE
WEST NEAR REGION 6197 (N13W01).  REGION 6199 IS DEVELOPING
RAPIDLY, INCREASING ITS SUNSPOT AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.
REGION 6197 CONTINUES TO DECAY.  REGION 6203 (N18E31) HAS
STARTED TO DECAY AND HAS PRODUCED A FEW SMALL FLARES.
REGION 6209 (N22E59) IS GROWING SLOWLY AND HAS ALSO PRODUCED
A FEW SMALL FLARES.  REGION 6212 (S27E78) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  THERE IS A CHANCE OF A MAJOR FLARE IN THE 6197/6199
SPOT COMPLEX.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE
LATITUDES.  HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS WERE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
WITH A FEW PERIODS OF STORM CONDITIONS AT CERTAIN STATIONS.
THE PROTON FLUX AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV IS ENHANCED BUT BELOW
THE 10 PFU EVENT THRESHOLD.  THIS ENHANCEMENT IS PROBABLY
RELATED TO THE M7 FLARE ON 10 AUGUST IN REGION 6203.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES.  INCREASED ACTIVITY IS
POSSIBLE AS A RESULT OF A CORONAL HOLE.
