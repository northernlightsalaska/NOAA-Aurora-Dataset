FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 163
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 12 JUN 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6089 (N09W46)
PRODUCED AN M6/2B TENFLARE AT 0541Z. THE 2695 MHZ BURST
REACHED 750 SFU AND A TYPE IV SWEEP WAS ASSOCIATED. AT 0051Z
AN M1/0B WITH TYPES II AND IV WAS ATTRIBUTED TO REGION 6096
(N26E14), A SIMPLE BXO TYPE GROUP. THIS REGION HAS SHOWN
ONLY SLIGHT GROWTH TODAY. ADDITIONAL SUBFLARING WAS NOTED
FROM REGIONS 6100 (S14E47) AND 6095 (N22W38). TWO NEW
REGIONS, 6105 (N13E59) AND 6106 (S30E56) WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6089 RETAINED ITS MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY AFTER
THE FLARE ALTHOUGH IT DIMINISHED SLIGHTLY IN SIZE. REGION
6095 HAS CONTINUED ITS GROWTH AND ALONG WITH REGION 6089
MAINTAINS THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS. A SUDDEN COMMENCEMENT OF 52 NANOTESLA OCCURRED AT
0820Z AS MEASURED AT BOULDER. THIS IS PROBABLY AN EFFECT
OF THE M3/1B FLARE AT 10/1506Z FROM REGION 6089, THEN AT
N08W13. THE GOES-6 AND 7 SATELIITES BOTH CROSSED THE
MAGNETOPAUSE, THE FIRST OCCURRENCE BEING ABOUT 1700Z.
A MODEST GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT BEGAN AT 1140Z,
AND HAS REACHED A TENTATIVE MAXIMUM OF 79 PFU AT 1700Z.
THIS EVENT IS THOUGHT TO BE THE RESULT OF THE M6/2B FLARE
FROM REGION 6089. ALSO A SMALL PCA BEGAN AT 1545Z AND
CONTINUES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD. THERE IS A DISTINCT CHANCE OF BRIEF MAJOR STORM
CONDITIONS.
