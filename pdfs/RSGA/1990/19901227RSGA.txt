SDF NUMBER 361 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. CLUSTERED REGIONS 6420
(S25W00), 6423 (S20W15), AND 6424 (S08W07) PRODUCED NEARLY ALL
OF TODAY'S FLARES, THE LARGEST A C6/1N AT 1748Z FROM 6420. THE
DISK HAS SEVEN SPOTTED REGIONS VISIBLE, AND THESE CAN BE
DESCRIBED AS EITHER STABLE OR IN DECAY. ALTHOUGH NONE APPEARS
PARTICULARLY OMINOUS, THERE ARE INTERACTIONS OCCURRING BETWEEN
ADJACENT REGIONS WITH SMALL FLARES RESULTING. NO NEW REGIONS
WERE ASSIGNED AND THE LIMBS WERE QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. OCCASIONAL M-CLASS ACTIVITY MAY OCCUR NEAR
CENTER DISK WHERE REGIONS 6420, 6423 AND 6424 ARE LOCATED.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD. A STRONG RESPONSE TO THE X1/2B FLARE OF 26/1402Z IS
NOT ANTICIPATED.
