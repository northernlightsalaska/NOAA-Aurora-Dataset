PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 15/0544Z. THIS REGION GREW SLOWLY
AND SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY WAS EVIDENT. FREQUENT SUBFLARES
EMANATED FROM THE TRAILER PLAGE. REGION 6410 (N04W05) ALSO GREW

X-RAY BURST WAS OBSERVED WITH THIS EVENT AND REACHED MAXIMUM
AT 15/0212Z. A MODERATE INTENSITY TYPE IV ACCOMPANIED THIS
EVENT AS DID A STRONG TYPE II WITH ESTIMATED SHOCK SPEED OF
800 KM/S.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A MODERATE LEVEL FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD. REGION 6412
SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING REGION. REGION 6410 IS
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE. THERE IS A
SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF A MAJOR FLARE FROM REGION 6412.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET DURING THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT QUIET TO SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE
DURATION OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
