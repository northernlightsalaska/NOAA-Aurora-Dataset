JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 357 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 DEC 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. THE MAIN EVENT OF THE
PERIOD WAS AN X1/2B TENFLARE FROM REGION 6412 (N16W79) AT
23/0952Z WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST RADIO BURST EMISSIONS
AND A MAJOR TYPE II SWEEP. THIS REGION ALSO PRODUCED
ISOLATED SUBFLARES AND A C8/1N EVENT AT 23/0041Z. REGION
6415 (N13 L-032) WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN M4/1N FLARE
WITH ASSOCIATED TYPE II AND IV SWEEP FREQUENCY BURSTS AT
22/2321Z PRIOR TO ROTATING AROUND THE LIMB EARLY IN THE PERIOD.
REGION 6420 (S24E44), PART OF A COMPLEX ELONGATED AREA IN THE
SOUTHEAST, HAS BEEN SPLIT WITH THE LEADING PORTION NOW
DESIGNATED AS NEW REGION 6423 (S20E40). 6420 HAS PRODUCED
NUMEROUS SUBFLARES ALONG WITH AN M5/2B EVENT AT 22/2246Z.
SOME MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE TRAILING PORTION
OF THIS REGION. REGION 6423 HAS PRODUCED ONLY ISOLATED
SUBFLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE IS POSSIBLE FROM
REGION 6412 PRIOR TO ITS DEPARTURE ON THE 24TH. REGION 6420
MAY PRODUCE OCCASIONAL M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A SUDDEN IMPULSE MEASURING
15 NANOTESLAS AT BOULDER WAS OBSERVED AT 22/2241Z.
SATELLITE LEVEL PROTONS AT GREATER THAN 10MEV BECAME
ENHANCED AT 23/1005Z AND REACHED A TENTATIVE PEAK OF 5 PFU
AT 23/1140Z WITH THE FIELD CURRENTLY RETURNING TO BACKGROUND
LEVELS. THE X1/2B FLARE FROM REGION 6412 WAS THE APPARENT
SOURCE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
ACTIVE CONDITIONS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
