(S12E07), AND 6226 (S21E09) EACH HAVE DEVELOPED SUNSPOT
AREAS OF OVER 1000 MILLIONTHS DURING THEIR TIME ON THE DISK.
THESE REGIONS HOWEVER HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO MUSTER C-CLASS
EVENTS FOR THE MOST PART. A C5/SF FLARE WAS CONTRIBUTED BY
REGION 6226 AT 22/2210Z. REGION 6223 MANAGED ONLY ISOLATED

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR
STORM LEVELS. MAJOR STORMING WAS OBSERVED BRIEFLY AT MIDDLE
LATITUDE STATIONS BETWEEN 23/0300-0900Z. HIGHER LATITUDES
HAVE EXPERIENCED MAJOR STORMING FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE
PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS AT THE
START OF THE PERIOD WITH THE TREND TOWARDS ACTIVE TO
