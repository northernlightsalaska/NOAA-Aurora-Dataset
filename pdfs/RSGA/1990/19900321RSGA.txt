SDF NUMBER 080
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 21 MAR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5974 (S34W19)
PRODUCED AN M1/1F FLARE AT 20/2309Z. THE REGION CONTINUED TO
GRADUALLY INCREASE IN BOTH SIZE AND THE STRENGTH OF ITS MAGNETIC
FIELDS. GROWTH WAS NOTED IN REGIONS 5978 (N17W08), 5983 (S33E33)
5984 (S13E25), AND 5988 (S08E53), ALL OF WHICH PRODUCED SMALL
FLARES DURING THE PERIOD. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGION 5974 IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE M-CLASS
ACTIVITY. IT ALSO PROVIDES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
MAJOR FLARE. REGIONS 5978, 5983, 5984, AND 5988 APPEAR CAPABLE
OF ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS. THE SEVERE STORMING OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF
THE PERIOD. THE STORMING WAS PRECEEDED BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF
76 NANOTESLA RECORDED BY THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER AT
20/2244Z. THE SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON AND POLAR CAP ABSORPTION
EVENTS ENDED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOSTLY MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE FIRST
DAY DUE TO THE CONTINUING EFFECTS OF THE X1/2B FLARE OF
19 MARCH. THE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
