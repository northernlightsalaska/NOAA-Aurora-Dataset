SDF NUMBER 269 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 SEP 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. TODAY'S MOST INTERESTING
EVENT WAS A LONG DURATION C7 X-RAY FLARE WHICH STARTED AT 1218Z
AND LASTED ALMOST TWO HOURS. THE EVENT WAS OPTICALLY CORRELATED
WITH FLARING OUT OF REGION 6272 (S13W85), WITH FLARE LOOPS AND
WITH AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE ON WEST LIMB AT S18. REGION 6279
(S08W61) SHOWED GROWTH TODAY AND PRODUCED A FEW C-CLASS SUB-
FLARES. REGIONS 6280 (N12W10) AND 6283 (N07E24) ALSO CONTRIBUTED
A COUPLE SUBFLARES. REGION 6280 MAY BE STARTING TO DECAY AS THE
PENUMBRA OF THE LARGE LEADER SPOT IS BEGINNING TO ELONGATE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW, BUT WITH A CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
M-CLASS EVENT FROM 6280 OR 6283. A GENERAL DOWNWARD TREND IN
ACTIVITY AND BACKGROUND LEVELS IS EXPECTED AS REGIONS 6272
AND 6279 WILL BE ROTATING OFF THE DISK OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:

ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS WERE REPORTED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS, BUT
WITH A POSSIBILITY FOR SOME ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS AT HIGH
