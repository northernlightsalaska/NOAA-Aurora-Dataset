JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 03 JUL 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6126 (S13W29)
CONTINUED TO PRODUCE THE MAJORITY OF FLARE ACTIVITY WITH A
C5/SF FLARE AT 03/0604Z NOTED AS THE LARGEST OF THE PERIOD.
THIS REGION APPEARS TO HAVE REACHED MATURITY NOW WITH A
SLIGHTLY COMPLEX MAGNETIC STRUCTURE STILL INTACT. REGION
6133 (N17E18) CONTINUES TO APPEAR THREATENING WITH ITS
LARGE SPOT AREA AND COMPLEX MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. HOWEVER A
SINGLE C4/SN FLARE, NOTED AT 03/0956Z, HAS BEEN THE ONLY
X-RAY EVENT OBSERVED FROM THIS AREA SINCE 30 JUNE. REGION
6131 (S21W11) DISPLAYED MODEST GROWTH IN SPOT AREA AND
SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED COMPLEXITY. THE REMAINING
REGIONS REMAINED GENERALLY STABLE. THREE UNCORRELATED
C-CLASS EVENTS WERE OBSERVED, POSSIBLY HAILING THE RETURN
OF OLD REGION 6100 (S14, L313) DUE TO ROTATE BACK ONTO THE
DISK ON 5 JULY. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. PREDOMINANTLY C-CLASS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED
WITH REGIONS 6126, 6131, AND 6133 POSING THE GREATEST THREAT
FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT GENERALLY QUIET TO
UNSETTLED LEVELS WITH A BRIEF PERIOD OF ACTIVE
CONDITIONS NOTED BETWEEN 0300-0600Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED WITH ACTIVE CONDITIONS POSSIBLE
AT THE END OF THE PERIOD IN RESPONSE TO EFFECTS FROM A
CORONAL HOLE.
