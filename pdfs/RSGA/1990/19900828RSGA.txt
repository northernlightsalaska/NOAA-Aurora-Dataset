JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 240 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6233 (N13E10)
PRODUCED A BARRAGE OF ENERGETIC FLARES WITH THE GREATEST AN
X3/2B TENFLARE WITH TYPE IV AT 27/2106Z, THE LARGEST X-RAY
FLARE IN MORE THAN THREE MONTHS. ITS' RESUME ALSO INCLUDED AN:
M4/1B AT 0909Z, M1/0N AT 1022Z, M4/1N AT 1253Z, AND M1/1N AT
1836Z. THE SITE OF MOST OF THE FLARING HAS BEEN IN THE INTER-
MEDIATE SPOTS WHERE A DELTA CONFIGURATION AND STRONG MAGNETIC
GRADIENTS ARE PRESENT. THIS REGION IS CERTAINLY THE MOST DOMIN-
ANT OF THE NINE SPOT GROUPS NOW VISIBLE, ALTHOUGH REGIONS 6226
(S21W55), 6227 (S23W42), AND 6223 (S12W53) YIELDED ISOLATED
SMALL FLARES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. LOOK FOR CONTINUED M-CLASS ACTIVITY FROM
6233, WITH X-CLASS FLARING VERY POSSIBLE. ALSO, REGION 6226
MAY AWAKEN TO PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BECOME DISTURBED IN ABOUT 24 HOURS, DUE TO
ANTICIPATED FLARE (X3/2B AT 27/2106Z) AND CORONAL HOLE
EFFECTS. MINOR STORM CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL 30 AUGUST AND
SUBSEQUENTLY WEAKEN BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
