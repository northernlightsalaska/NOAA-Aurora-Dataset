SDF NUMBER 134
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 14 MAY 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6063 (N34E43)
REMAINS THE LARGEST AND MOST MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX AREA ON THE
DISK. NUMEROUS C-CLASS SUBFLARES WERE ATTRIBUTED TO THE REGION
THIS PERIOD ALONG WITH AN M1/1N FLARE AT 14/1455Z. REGION
6064 (S15E64) CONTINUED TO MATURE. SPOT AREA OVER THE PAST
24 HOURS HAS NEARLY DOUBLED. INCREASED MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY
WAS NOTED AS WELL. A C4/1N FLARE AT 14/1646Z WAS THE LARGEST
EVENT NOTED FROM THIS REGION TODAY. REGION 6060 (N23E13)
SHOWED MINOR GROWTH WHILE PRODUCING OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES.
REGION 6058 (N13W16) ALSO SHOWED GROWTH IN SPOT AND PLAGE AREA.
AN IMPRESSIVE ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED AT 14/1914Z
ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB NEAR THE LATITUDE OF S42.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY MODERATE. REGIONS 6063 AND 6064 PROVIDE THE BEST
CHANCES FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY WITH 6063 ALSO SHOWING FAVORABLE
CHARACTERISTICS FOR MAJOR FLARE PRODUCTION. REGIONS 6060,
6058, AND 6054 (S17W30) MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ACTIVITY LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED
BRIEFLY AT THE START OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD. DAY THREE MAY BE MORE DISTURBED DUE TO EFFECTS FROM
A CORONAL HOLE.
