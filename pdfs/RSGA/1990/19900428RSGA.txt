SDF NUMBER 118
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 28 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY A FEW LOW-LEVEL C-
CLASS SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD. THE MOST
INTERESTING OF THESE WAS A LONG DURATION EVENT FROM 27/2227-
28/0038Z WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A TYPE II RADIO SWEEP, AND
POSSIBLY WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A FILAMENT WHICH WAS LOCATED
AT S42W42. THE PEAK X-RAY FLUX FOR THE EVENT WAS C2 AT 0026Z.
THE ONLY REGIONS PRODUCING FLARES WERE 6042 (S19W48) AND 6038
(N17W51). THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK WAS QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. ADDITIONAL LOW-LEVEL ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS 6038
AND 6042.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS DURING THE DAY. OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CON-
DITIONS OCCURRED AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM 0600-1330Z. A GREATER
THAN 10MEV PROTON EVENT BEGAN AT 1005Z AND CONTINUES IN PRO-
GRESS. THE PEAK FLUX SO FAR IS 140 PFU AT 1855Z. THERE IS
ALSO AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE HIGHER ENERGY PARTICLES: THE
GREATER THAN 50 MEV PARTICLE FLUXES ATTAINED 3 PFU AT 1720Z,
ABOUT TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVELS. THE
EVENT MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE LONG-DURATION DSF EVENT
MENTIONED EARLIER.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE
INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO START TOMORROW, PEAK ON THE SECOND DAY
AND GRADUALLY DIMINISH ON THE THIRD DAY. THE FORECAST IS BASED
PRIMARILY ON RECURRENCE, BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF TODAY'S LONG
DURATION/DISAPPEARING FILAMENT EVENT.
