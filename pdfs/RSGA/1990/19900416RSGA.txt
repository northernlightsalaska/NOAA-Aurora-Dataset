M2/2B FLARE AT 16/0042Z. LITTLE CHANGE IN THE SIZE OR COMPLEXITY
OF THIS REGION WAS NOTED. REGION 6012 (N31W60) PRODUCED A C9/SN

MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6021 AND 6022 ARE BOTH CAPABLE OF
MAJOR FLARE PRODUCTION. REGION 6018 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE
ADDITIONAL ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  SATELLITE LEVEL PROTONS AT
GREATER THAN 10 MEV HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY ELEVATED ABOVE
BACKGROUND LEVELS THIS PERIOD IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT
X-CLASS FLARE EVENTS. LEVELS SO FAR HAVE REMAINED WELL
BELOW ALERT CRITERIA.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS THE NEXT
THREE DAY'S WITH THE EFFECT'S FROM TODAY'S X2/2B FLARE POSSIBLE
BY 18 APRIL. AN ISOLATED NORTHERN HEMISPHERE CORONAL HOLE MAY
ALSO ADD TO ACTIVITY LEVELS STARTING 18 APRIL. SATELLITE LEVEL
PROTON'S SHOULD SLOWLY RETURN TO BACKGROUND LEVELS.
