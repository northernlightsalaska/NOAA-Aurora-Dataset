SDF NUMBER 136
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 16 MAY 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6063 (N33E16)
SHOWED SOME DECAY IN SPOT NUMBER AND AREA BUT REMAINS VERY
COMPLEX WITH IT'S REVERSED POLARITY DELTA SPOT CONFIGURATION.
IT PRODUCED THE ONLY M-CLASS EVENT OF THE PERIOD: AN M1/1B
FLARE AT 16/0109Z. OCCASIONAL SUBFLARING WAS ALSO NOTED.
REGION 6064 (S16E27) DISPLAYED RAPID GROWTH IN THE LAST 24
HOURS, EXCEEDING REGION 6063 IN SPOT NUMBER AND AREA. THE
REGION DOES NOT HAVE A STRONGLY COMPLEX MAGNETIC STRUCTURE AT
THIS TIME HOWEVER, WITH ITS EXPANDING PLAGE FIELD AND RAPID
SPOT GROWTH, IT SHOWS PROMISE AS A MAJOR FLARE PRODUCER.
OCCASIONAL LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS ACTIVITY AND SUBFLARING
CHARACTERIZED REGIONS 6060 (N23W13) AND 6054 (S16W53). NEW
REGION 6068 (N09E65) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 6063 AND 6064 BOTH HAVE THE POTENTIAL
FOR MAJOR FLARING. REGIONS 6060 AND 6054 MAY CONTRIBUTE
ISOLATED C-CLASS ACTIVITY.
