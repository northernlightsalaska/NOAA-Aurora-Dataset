JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 244 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 SEP 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. ONE M-CLASS EVENT WAS
OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD: AN M2/SN FROM REGION 6233 (N13W46)
AT 0710Z. THE REGION APPEARED TO BE UNDERGOING SOME DECAY AND
SIMPLIFICATION ALTHOUGH IT CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A MAGNETIC
DELTA CONFIGURATION. NOTABLE GROWTH, BUT NO FLARE ACTIVITY,
WAS OBSERVED IN REGIONS 6238 (S13E11) AND 6244 (N13E29). A 22
DEGREE FILAMENT CENTERED AT N11E55 DISAPPEARED SOMETIME BETWEEN
31/2126Z AND 01/1051Z. THE EVENT APPEARED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
A LONG DURATION C4 X-RAY EVENT THAT WAS OBSERVED FROM 0145Z TO
0403Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. THE MAIN THREAT FOR M-CLASS OR GREATER FLARES IS RE-
GION 6233. REGIONS 6238 AND 6244 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE OCCASIONAL
SMALL FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED UNTIL 1240Z WHEN
A SUDDEN IMPULSE OCCURRED. STORM LEVELS FOLLOWED THE IMPULSE
FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS, BUT CONDITIONS SUBSIDED SOMEWHAT TOWARD
THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE SOURCE OF THE DISTURBANCE IS
UNCERTAIN BUT COULD HAVE BEEN A RESULT OF THE LONG DURATION
M1 FLARE THAT OCCURRED EARLY ON 30 AUGUST.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR ABOUT HALF-
WAY THROUGH THE FIRST DAY, AND SHOULD GRADUALLY DECLINE TO
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS BY THE SECOND DAY. GENERALLY ACTIVE
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO RESUME EARLY ON THE THIRD DAY AS A
RESPONSE TO TODAY'S DISAPPEARING FILAMENT.
