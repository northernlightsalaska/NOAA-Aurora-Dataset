JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 296 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE LARGEST EVENT WAS A
C4 FROM REGION 6331 (N18E10) AT 23/1621UT.  THIS REGION AND
REGION 6327 (N18W10) REMAIN THE LARGEST ON THE DISK.  TYPE II/IV
SWEEPS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING OPTICAL EVENT, WERE OBSERVED AT
23/0809UT.  THIS EVENT MAY HAVE BEEN FROM DEPARTED REGIONS
BEYOND THE WEST LIMB.  SEVERAL CORONAL HOLES ARE VISIBLE, ONE
IS CENTERED ON THE EQUATOR NEAR W40, ANOTHER NEAR N25E55.  THE
FILAMENT NEAR S15W30 DISAPPEARED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE.  REGIONS 6327 AND 6331 ARE THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCES FOR ENERGETIC ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.  A SMALL PROTON ENHANCEMENT BEGAN AROUND
23/0900UT.  THIS INCREASE AND THE TYPE II SWEEP MENTIONED IN
PART IA MAY BE FROM THE SAME SOURCE, AN EVENT FROM BEHIND
THE WEST LIMB.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.  THE DSF OF 19 OCT AND A
