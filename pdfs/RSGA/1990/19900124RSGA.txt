SDF NUMBER 024
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 24 JAN 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5892 (S28W06)
PRODUCED AN M1/2B LONG DURATION PARALLEL RIBBON FLARE THAT MAXED
AT 2022 UT.  REGION 5892 HAS GROWN IN WHITE LIGHT AND IS NOW
MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX. REGION 5900 (S09E37), THE LARGEST REGION
ON THE DISK, REMAINED MOSTLY STABLE EXCEPT THAT IT SIMPLIFIED
SOMEWHAT MAGNETICALLY.  FOUR NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED TODAY.
SURGING ON THE WEST LIMB ACCOMPANIED THE DEPARTURE OF REGIONS
5881 (S30) AND 5882 (N21), AND SURGING ON THE EAST LIMB WAS
OBSERVED NEAR S21. A SMALL FILAMENT DISAPPEARED IN THE SOLAR
SOUTHEAST QUADRANT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  SIGNIFICANT FLARES ARE LIKELY FROM REGION 5900, AND
ARE POSSIBLE FROM 5892 AND 5890 (S11W29).
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES, WITH
PERIODS AT STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES. THIS ACTIVITY
IS PRESUMED TO BE DUE TO EXPECTED EFFECTS FROM FILAMENT
DISAPPEARANCES AND A HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND STREAM FROM A
NORTHERN CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD, WITH A TREND TOWARD UNSETTLED LEVELS BY THE
THIRD DAY.  THIS ACTIVITY IS FORECAST IN RESPONSE TO
FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCES ON 21, 22 AND 23 JANUARY.
