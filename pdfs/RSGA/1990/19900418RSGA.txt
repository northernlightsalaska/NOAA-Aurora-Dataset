FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 108
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 18 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THE LARGEST EVENT
OF THE PERIOD WAS AN M1/1N FLARE AT 18/0400Z FROM REGION
6018 (S31W22). THIS REGION HAS BECOME MORE COMPLEX MAGNETICALLY
WHILE DECAYING IN SIZE. SEVERAL MINOR SUBFLARES WERE ALSO
ATTRIBUTED TO THIS REGION. REGION 6021 (S14E06) SUPPLIED THE
ONLY OTHER M-CLASS EVENT OF THE PERIOD: AN M1/1F FLARE AT
18/0342Z. GENERAL DECAY NOTED HERE ALSO. REGION 6022 (N31E02)
REMAINED QUIET DESPITE IT'S SIZE AND APPARENT COMPLEXITY.
REGION 6031 (S18E34) HAS GROWN RAPIDLY WHILE PRODUCING NUMEROUS
FLARES. THE LARGEST OF WHICH, A C5/SF FLARE AT 18/0212Z.
THE REMAINING REGIONS WERE GENERALLY STABLE. REGION 6032
(S12E26) WAS ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS
6018, 6021, OR 6022 WITH 6021 AND 6022 POSSESSING THE BEST
POTENTIAL FOR ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE PRODUCTION. REGION 6031
MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ELEVATED ACTIVITY LEVELS AS IT MATURES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS WITH BRIEF MINOR STORMING
OBSERVED NEAR THE START OF THE PERIOD. FURTHER ANALYSIS
OF SATELLITE LEVEL PROTON DATA INDICATES THE LOW-LEVEL
ENHANCEMENT OF GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTONS IS STILL IN
PROGRESS WITH FLUXES NEAR OR ABOVE THE 10 PFU THRESHOLD.
THIS EVENT BEGAN 17/0500Z WITH A TENTATIVE PEAK OF 12 PFU
OBSERVED SO FAR.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS THE FIRST
DAY DECLINING TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.
