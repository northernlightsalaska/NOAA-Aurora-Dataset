JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 238 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 6226 (S22W29)
PRODUCED AN M5/2N AT 1624Z THAT INITIATED SMALLER SYMPATHETIC
FLARES IN NEARBY REGIONS 6227 (S23W14) AND 6223 (S13W32).
MODEST RADIO BURSTS WERE RECORDED ACROSS THE SPECTRUM AS WELL
AS A POSSIBLE TYPE II. REGION 6233 (N14E38), WITH A COMPLEX
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE AND BRIGHT PLAGE, YIELDED AN M1/1N AT
1354Z. CURRENTLY REGIONS 6233 AND 6226 ARE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
ON THE DISK AND RETAIN THEIR POTENCY. REGION 6214, NOW BEYOND
WEST LIMB NEAR S15, PRODUCED SURGING AS IT DEPARTED.
**NOTE: TODAY'S 10.7 CM OTTAWA FLUX MAY BE FLARE ENHANCED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. MAJOR FLARES (M5 OR GREATER) ARE
DISTINCTLY POSSIBLE FROM EITHER REGION 6226 OR REGION 6233.
ALSO, THE CHANCE OF PROTONS FROM AN ENERGETIC FLARE IS
INCREASED AS REGION 6226 ROTATES TO A FAVORABLE POSITION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS SINCE EARLY TODAY. A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 29 NANO-
TESLA WAS MEASURED AT BOULDER AT 0543Z. THE SOURCE OF THIS
SHOCK IS UNKNOWN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE
CURRENT DISTURBANCE IS LIKELY TO ABATE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
