JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 227 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THREE C-CLASS SUBFLARES
WERE OBSERVED. REGION 6199 (N12W16) REMAINED IN A SLOW GROWTH
PHASE AND CONTINUED TO EXHIBIT MODERATE MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. NEW
REGION 6217 (S19E31) WAS NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6199 CONTINUES AS A THREAT FOR ISOLATED
M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING
WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES. THIS ACTIVITY IS MOST LIKELY
IN RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED TRANSEQUATORIAL CORONAL
HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO UNSETTLED LEVELS. THE ACTIVE
LEVELS ARE EXPECTED DUE TO CONTINUING CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
THESE EFFECTS SHOULD BEGIN TO SUBSIDE MIDWAY THROUGH THE
PERIOD.
