IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. SIX OF THE EIGHT SPOTTED
REGIONS PRODUCED LOW-LEVEL FLARES, BUT NONE EXCEEDED THE C-5
LEVEL. MOST GROUPS WERE STABLE WITH THE EXCEPTION BEING REGION
6106 (S31E31) WHICH GREW SUBSTANTIALLY IN WHITE LIGHT AND
H-ALPHA. A 10 DEGREE-LONG FILAMENT DISAPPEARED FROM N40W37
VERY EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITHOUT ANY ACCOMPANYING X-RAY
ENHANCEMENT.

LOW TO MODERATE. ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY MAY COME FROM

BOULDER OCCURRED AT 0310Z. RECENT FLARE AND FILAMENT
ACTIVITY MAKES IDENTIFICATION OF THE SOLAR ORIGIN DIFFICULT,
