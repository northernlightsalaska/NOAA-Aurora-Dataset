JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 292 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 19 OCT 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. THE MOST NOTABLE FEATURE
OF TODAY'S ACTIVITY WAS A MARKED INCREASE IN X-RAY AND 10.7
BACKGROUND LEVELS. X-RAY FLUX LEVELS WERE RUNNING AT OR ABOVE
C3 FOR MUCH OF THE DAY IN COMPARISON TO C1 YESTERDAY. THE 10.7
FLUX JUMPED FROM 195 TO 221. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE ENHANCE-
NMENT IS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT FROM REGIONS 6327
(N16E43) AND 6331 (N17E63). TODAY'S LARGEST FLARE EVENT WAS
A C7/SN FROM REGION 6322 (S08W19) AT 1014Z. FREQUENT ADDITIONAL
SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD, MOSTLY FROM REGIONS
6322 AND 6327, ALTHOUGH 6311 (N15W78) ALSO MADE SOME CONTRI-
BUTIONS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MOSTLY LOW. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
EVENT FROM EITHER REGION 6322 OR REGION 6237.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A BRIEF
ACTIVE PERIOD WAS REPORTED AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM 0900-1200Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY UNSETTLED.
