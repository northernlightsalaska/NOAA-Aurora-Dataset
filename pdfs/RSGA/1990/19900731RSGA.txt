TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE
DAY WAS A C2/SF AT 1953Z FROM REGION 6172 (S24W30).  ADDITIONAL
SUBFLARING WAS OBSERVED FROM REGIONS 6174 (S11W26) AND 6184
(S09E17).  THREE NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED ON THE EAST LIMB
TODAY 6185 (N23E73), 6186 (N16E75) AND 6187 (S07E71).  THESE
MAY BE THE RETURN OF OLD REGIONS 6154, 6150, AND 6151
RESPECTIVELY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  A SLIGHT CHANCE OF M-CLASS FLARING STILL EXISTS IN THE
INTERACTION BETWEEN REGIONS 6172 AND 6174.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  A PERIOD OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS WAS
RECORDED EARLY IN THE DAY.  A PROTON ENHANCEMENT BEGAN AROUND
0600Z, PASSED 4PFU AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV AROUND 2030Z AND
CONTINUES IN PROGRESS.  THIS ENHANCEMENT IS MOST LIKELY IN
RESPONSE TO THE M4/2B LDE EARLY ON 30 JULY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED.  SOME PERIODS OF ACTIVE
CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY IN RESPONSE TO THE M4/2B LDE AND A
FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.  IF THE CURRENT PROTON
ENHANCEMENT REACHES EVENT LEVELS, IT IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN
ABOVE THE EVENT THRESHOLD ONLY A SHORT TIME.
