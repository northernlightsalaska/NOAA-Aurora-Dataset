FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 128
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 08 MAY 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6049 (N18E03)
PRODUCED AN M3/SF FLARE AT 08/1855Z. THE FLARE WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH A SIGNIFICANT TYPE II SWEEP WITH AN ESTIMATED SHOCK SPEED
OF 800-1000 KM/SEC. THIS REGION'S RATE OF GROWTH STABILIZED, BUT
IT REMAINED THE MOST COMPLEX OF THE VISIBLE REGIONS. GROWING
REGION 6054 (S17E51) PRODUCED AN M1/1B AT 08/0027Z ACCOMPANIED
BY MINOR DISCRETE RADIO EMISSIONS. REGION 6052 (S12W10) REMAINED
IN A SLOW GROWTH PHASE AND PRODUCED ISOLATED SUBFLARES. INTENSE
IRON XIV CORONAL EMISSION WAS REPORTED ON THE SOUTHEAST LIMB
NEAR WHERE OLD REGION 6021 IS EXPECTED TO RETURN (EARLY ON 10
MAY). OLD REGION 6021 WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MODERATE TO HIGH
LEVELS OF ACTIVITY ON ITS LAST TRANSIT. THREE SMALL NEW REGIONS
WERE ASSIGNED TODAY: 6057 (S47W37), 6058 (N13E64), AND 6059
(S08W62).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. MOSTLY C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM
REGIONS 6049, 6052, AND 6054. REGION 6049 REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL
THREAT FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS INCREASING
TO ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THIS
INCREASE IS EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
