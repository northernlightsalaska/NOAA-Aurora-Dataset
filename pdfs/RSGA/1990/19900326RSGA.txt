JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 26 MAR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
ACTIVITY OF THE PERIOD WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REGION 5984 (S13W44).
THIS REGION PRODUCED AN M3/1N TENFLARE AT 26/0340Z AND AN M2/1N
FLARE AT 26/0508Z. SEVERAL SUBFLARES WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO
THIS REGION WHICH IS NOW THE MOST COMPLEX ON THE DISK. AN
UNCORRELATED M2 X-RAY EVENT OCCURED AT 26/0535Z. REGION 5974
(S33W80) BECAME MORE ACTIVE THROUGH THE PERIOD. REGION 5988
(S07W13) EXHIBITED SLOW DECAY IN SPOT COVERAGE WHILE
CONTINUING TO PRODUCE OCCASIONAL C-CLASS EVENTS. THE LAST,
A C6/SN FLARE AT 26/1602Z, RESULTED IN THE ERUPTION OF A FIVE
DEGREE SEGMENT OF FILAMENT MATERIAL. NO NEW REGIONS WERE
ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. M-CLASS EVENTS MAY OCCUR FROM REGIONS 5988 AND
5984. REGION 5974 MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE AN ISOLATED M-FLARE
BEFORE IT DEPARTS THE DISK LATE TOMORROW. ISOLATED MAJOR
FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM ANY OF THESE REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS WITH MAJOR STORMING OBSERVED
AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR STORM LEVELS AT THE START OF THE
PERIOD WITH THE TREND TOWARDS ACTIVE CONDITIONS BY THE END
OF THE FIRST DAY. ACTIVE LEVELS SHOULD PERSIST THROUGHOUT
THE REMAINDER OF FORECAST PERIOD. CORONAL HOLES APPEAR TO
BE THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURBANCE.
