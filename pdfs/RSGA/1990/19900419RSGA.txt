JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 19 APR 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE TWO
FAIRLY COMPLEX REGIONS ON THE DISK, NEITHER IS CURRENTLY
PRODUCING ANY SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY. REGION 6022 (N30W08)
CONTINUED TO SLOWLY DECAY IN SPOT AREA WHILE MAINTAINING
IT'S COMPLEXITY. A C5/1F FLARE AT 19/1600Z FROM THIS REGION,
WAS THE LARGEST EVENT OF THE PERIOD. REGION 6021 (S15W03)
REMAINED GENERALLY STABLE WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL SUB-FLARING
NOTED. REGIONS 6018 (S32W34) AND 6031 (S19E22) CONTRIBUTED
OCCASIONAL LOW-LEVEL C-CLASS ACTIVITY. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE
WAS OBSERVED AT 19/1408Z FROM DEPARTING REGION 6012 (N31 WEST
LIMB). NEW REGIONS 6033 (N11E68) AND 6034 (S08E76) WERE
ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGIONS 6021 AND 6022 PROVIDE THE BEST CHANCE
FOR M-CLASS EVENTS WITH 6022 EASILY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
AN ISOLATED MAJOR FLARE.
