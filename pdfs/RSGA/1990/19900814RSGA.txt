JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 226 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 AUG 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 6203 (N19E18)
PRODUCED A C8/1B FLARE AT 13/2229Z WHILE CONTINUING IN A GRADUAL
DECAY PHASE. REGION 6199 (N12W01) SLOWED ITS RATE OF GROWTH
CONSIDERABLY AND PRODUCED A SINGLE SUBFLARE. THIS REGION
REMAINED MODERATELY COMPLEX IN MAGNETIC ASPECTS. REGION 6197
(N14W14) PRODUCED ISOLATED SUBFLARES. NEW REGIONS 6213 (N06W30),
6214 (S10E60), 6215 (N12E70), AND 6216 (N10E28) WERE NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. INTERACTION BETWEEN REGIONS 6197 AND 6199 MAY SPAWN
AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE. THERE IS ALSO A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
A MAJOR FLARE FROM THIS COMPLEX.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE HIGH LATITUDE FIELD REACHED MINOR
TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS. THIS ACTIVITY WAS PROBABLY IN RESPONSE
TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED TRANSEQUATORIAL CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT MIDDLE
LATITUDES AND AT ACTIVE LEVELS AT HIGHER LATITUDES. CORONAL
HOLE EFFECTS MAY CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.
