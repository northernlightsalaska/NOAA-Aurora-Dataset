(S12E33) HAS SHOWN MODEST GROWTH IN SPOT AREA TODAY AND
APPEARS SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX. NUMEROUS FLARES HAVE
BEEN OBSERVED FROM THIS AREA TO INCLUDE AN M1/1N FLARE
WITH MODEST RADIO EMISSIONS AT 17/0555Z, AN M1/SB FLARE
AT 17/1346Z, AND A C6/1B FLARE AT 17/1853Z. REGION 6266
(S26W08) HAS PRODUCED ISOLATED SUBFLARES. THE LAST OF WHICH
AT 17/1701Z PROMPTED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A 20 DEGREE SEGMENT
OF FILAMENT. AN EVENT LEVEL BRIGHT SURGE WAS NOTED ON THE
EAST LIMB AT N16 AT 17/1231Z. NEW REGIONS 6276 (S21E22)
AND 6277 (S32W32) WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 6272 PROVIDES THE BEST THREAT FOR ISOLATED
M-CLASS ACTIVITY. MODERATE LEVELS MAY BECOME MORE ENHANCED
TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD WITH THE RETURN OF OLD REGION
6233 (N13 L-034) WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR NUMEROUS M FLARES
DURING ITS LAST ROTATION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE
NOTED BRIEFLY AT HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
