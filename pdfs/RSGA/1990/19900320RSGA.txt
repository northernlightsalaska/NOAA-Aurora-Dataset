IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE TO HIGH. REGIONS 5969, 5974, 5983, AND 5988 ARE
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING M-CLASS ACTIVITY. REGION 5974 ALSO

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WERE
RECORDED AT HIGH LATITUDES LATE IN THE PERIOD. THE SATELLITE
LEVEL PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN AT 19/0705Z REACHED A MAXIMUM
FLUX OF 950 PFU AT 19/2315Z AND REMAINED IN PROGRESS AT THE
END OF THE PERIOD. THE POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENT WHICH
BEGAN AT 19/1015Z REACHED ITS MAXIMUM OF 9.1 DB AT 19/1615Z.
IT TOO WAS IN PROGRESS AT THE END OF THE SUMMARY PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE
FIRST TWO DAYS DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF YESTERDAY'S X-FLARE. THE
FIELD IS EXPECTED TO SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE
FINAL DAY OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. BOTH THE SATELLITE LEVEL
PROTON AND POLAR CAP ABSORPTION EVENTS ARE EXPECTED TO END
