IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 20/2100Z
TO 21/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6311 (ONE DAY
BEYOND WEST LIMB AT N14) PRODUCED TODAY'S LARGEST EVENT: AN M3-
SF AT 0602Z. THE REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/SF AT 0320Z. LOOPS
WERE VISIBLE FROM THIS REGION OUT TO .03 RADII FROM 1740-1954Z.
AN ADDITIONAL M-FLARE WAS PRODUCED BY REGION 6327 (N18E16): AN
M1/SF AT 1008Z. REGION 6327 IS NOW THE LARGEST REGION ON THE
DISK AS AN E-TYPE GROUP OF 310 MILLIONTHS. REGION 6322 (S08W46)
WAS QUIET AND IS CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED IN SIZE AND FLARE POT-
TENTIAL.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 6311 WILL BE TWO DAYS BEYOND WEST LIMB AND IS NOT
EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE ANY MORE FLARES. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE
FOR ANOTHER ISOLATED M-FLARE FROM REGION 6327 DURING THE FORE-
CAST PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 20/2100Z TO 21/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED, WITH SOME PERIODS
OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS. AN IN-
CREASE TO ACTIVE LEVELS IS EXPECTED ON THE THIRD DAY IN RE-
SPONSE TO A 30 DEGREE FILAMENT THAT DISAPPEARED ON THE 19TH.
