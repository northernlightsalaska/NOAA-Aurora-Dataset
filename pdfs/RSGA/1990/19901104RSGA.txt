JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 308 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 NOV 1990
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 6350
(S26E12) DISPLAYED RAPID GROWTH THIS PERIOD WHILE PRODUCING
ISOLATED SUBFLARING. INTERACTION BETWEEN THIS AREA HOWEVER AND
REGION 6347 (S19E11) JUST TO THE NORTH MAY HAVE ASSISTED IN THE
PRODUCTION OF 6347'S M2/1B TENFLARE AT 04/1741Z WHICH WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY RICH RADIO BURST EMISSIONS. THIS REGION HAD
SHOWN AN INCREASE IN SUBFLARING DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. REGION
6345 (S05W18) CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN SPOT AREA WHILE
PRODUCING OCCASIONAL SUBFLARES. NEW REGIONS 6355 (N16E02),
6356 (S23E23), 6357 (S11E62), AND 6358 (N17E74) WERE ASSIGNED.
SURGING CONTINUES TO BE OBSERVED ON THE NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST
LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY LOW HOWEVER INTERACTION BETWEEN REGION 6347 AND
6350 MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED M-EVENT.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED WITH A CHANCE OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS
BEGINING ON THE 6TH IN RESPONSE TO EFFECTS FROM A RETURNING
CORONAL HOLE.
