JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 163 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 JUN 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. HOWEVER, AN 18 DEGREE
FILAMENT LOCATED FROM ABOUT N07E01-S07W10 FADED BETWEEN
APPROXIMATELY 12/1400-1630Z. A LONG DURATION B2 X-RAY
ENHANCEMENT ACCOMPANIED THE ERUPTION. A TEMPORARY CORONAL HOLE
WAS VISIBLE NEAR THE ERUPTION IN A HE 10830A SPECTROHELIOGRAM
AT 1617Z. REGION 7730 (S10E10) DEVELOPED SOME MIXED
POLARITIES DURING THE PERIOD. A SMALL NEW REGION ROTATED INTO
VIEW AT S13E77 AND WAS NUMBERED AS REGION 7735.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE VERY
LOW TO LOW. REGION 7730 HAS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER POTENTIAL FOR
A SMALL C-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOME
MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT SOME SITES
DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE PERIOD. ENERGETIC ELECTRON
FLUXES WERE LOW TO MODERATE FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD
AND HIGH FOR THE SECOND HALF.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT
TWO DAYS. SOME SITES MAY EXPERIENCE MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
PERIODS AS THE CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE SLOWLY
SUBSIDES. A FILAMENT RELATED DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO
BEGIN MIDDAY ON 15 JUN. MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS
ARE FORECAST FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THAT DAY.
