JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 013 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 JAN 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED VERY LOW. ONLY MINOR
B-CLASS ENHANCEMENTS WERE OBSERVED FROM REGION 7650 (N05W55)
AND 7648 (N07W68). REGION 7648 EXHIBITED SOME DECAY. THE
MAUNA LOA OBSERVATORY REPORTED A CORONAL MASS EJECTION FROM
NEAR N13E90 BETWEEN 12/1930-2200Z. NO SIGNIFICANT X-RAY OR
RADIO ENHANCEMENTS WERE OBSERVED DURING THAT TIME. THE
EJECTION LIKELY OCCURRED FROM OLD REGION 7640 WHICH SHOULD
BE NEARING THE EAST LIMB AT THOSE LATITUDES. YOHKOH IMAGES
SHOW A BROAD AREA OF DIFFUSE X-RAY EMISSION AT THE NORTHEAST
LIMB WITH SMALL BRIGHTER STREAMERS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD INCREASE
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS PREVIOUSLY ACTIVE LONGITUDES
ROTATE INTO VIEW. THE POSSIBILITY OF M-CLASS ACTIVITY EXISTS
FROM THIS AREA. A BETTER ASSESSMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE ONCE
OLD REGION 7640 (AND OTHERS NEARBY) BECOME VISIBLE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS GENERALLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AS
THE CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE CONTINUED. AS IN
PREVIOUS DAYS, SOME SITES EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF MINOR TO
MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD CONTINUE AT UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS FOR 14 JAN.
MOSTLY UNSETTLED LEVELS ARE FORECAST FOR 15-16 JAN.
ISOLATED ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE DURING THAT TIME
AS THE DISTURBANCE SLOWLY SUBSIDES.
