JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 122 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 02 MAY 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 01/2100Z
TO 02/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. VERY LITTLE ACTIVITY
OCCURRED DURING THE DAY, BUT THE SUN CONTINUES TO GENERATE
NUMEROUS SMALL CENTERS OF EMERGING FLUX. REGIONS 7713 (N07E26)
AND 7715 (N08W42) SHOWED STEADY GROWTH DURING THE PERIOD.
A NEW REGION NUMBER 7716 (N02W14) WAS ASSIGNED TO NEWLY
EMERGING SPOTS TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. RECENT GROWTH IN 7713 SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A FAIR CHANCE
FOR AN ISOLATED C-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 01/2100Z TO 02/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM
LEVELS. MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS DOMINATED FROM
01/2100Z THROUGH ABOUT 02/1200Z. CONDITIONS SUBSIDED TO
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. THE
DISTURBANCE IS PROBABLY THE RESULT OF A FAVORABLY PO-
SITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE AT MID-LATITUDES AND MINOR STORM AT HIGH
LATITUDES FOR THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS DUE TO PERSISTENCE. CON-
DITIONS SHOULD TRANSITION TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS ON THE
