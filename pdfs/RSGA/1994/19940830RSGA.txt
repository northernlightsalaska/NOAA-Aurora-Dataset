JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 242 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY BECAME MODERATE. NEW REGION 7773
(S07E73) PRODUCED M1/SF FLARES AT 0833Z AND 1037Z. NUMEROUS
C-CLASS FLARES ALSO ORIGINATED FROM 7773. RECENT WHITE LIGHT
OBSERVATIONS CLASSIFY THIS REGION AS A MODERATE SIZE F CLASS
GROUP WITH SOME INTERIOR SPOT DISTRIBUTION. PLAGE INTENSITY
WAS MODERATE TO HIGH. IT IS LIKELY THIS REGION IS IN A GROWTH
PHASE DUE TO FLARE FREQUENCY AND PLAGE BRIGHTNESS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
MODERATE. THE POSSIBILITY OF AN X-CLASS FLARE FROM REGION
7773 EXISTS. A MORE CONFIDENT ASSESSMENT WILL BE
POSSIBLE ONCE THE REGION ROTATES FARTHER ONTO THE DISK AND
RELIABLE MAGNETIC DATA CAN BE OBTAINED.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET AT MID LATITUDES AND QUIET TO SLIGHTLY
UNSETTLED AT HIGH LATITUDES.
