JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 075 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 MAR 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. REGIONS 7688 (N19W06)
AND 7692 (N18E57) ARE THE SOLE SPOT GROUPS VISIBLE. BOTH HAVE
BEEN QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW THROUGHOUT THE INTERVAL.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN QUIET TO ACTIVE AT MIDDLE
LATITUDE SITES. HIGH LATITUDES EXPERIENCED UNSETTLED TO
ACTIVE CONDITIONS. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON FLUXES
REMAINED AT LEVELS COMPARABLE TO THOSE OBSERVED OVER THE PAST
WEEK.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. EPISODES OF ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS MAY
OCCUR DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME HOURS.

PLANNING FOR FUTURE SOLAR OPTICAL AND SOLAR RADIO
OBSERVATIONS IS IN PROGRESS.  CONSIDERATION IS BEING GIVEN
TO HAVING NO REGULAR SOLAR ACTIVITY PATROL IN THE OPTICAL
AND RADIO WAVELENGTHS.  THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF NO
SYNOPTIC IMAGES.  CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO US ANY CRITICAL
IMPACTS SUCH ACTIONS WOULD HAVE ON YOUR OPERATIONS OR
RESEARCH.  PLEASE REPLY TO SESC NO LATER THAN 23 MARCH 1994.
