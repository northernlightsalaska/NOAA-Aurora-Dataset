JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 182 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 JUL 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DUE TO A M2/1B FLARE
FROM REGION 7742 (S09E15) AT 30/2124Z. MODERATE CENTIMETER
BURSTS AND A STRONG TYPE II ACCOMPANIED THE EVENT. THIS REGION
REMAINED MOSTLY STABLE IN WHITE LIGHT AREA BUT THE NUMBER OF
SMALL SPOTS INCREASED. A NEW REGION NEAR NE12 IS VISIBLE IN
RECENT YOHKOH IMAGERY. A REGION NUMBER WILL BE ASSIGNED HERE
ONCE SPOTS ARE VISIBLE. A TRANSEQUATORIAL CORONAL HOLE THAT
WAS VISIBLE LAST ROTATION IS NOT VISIBLE NOW IN THE
EASTERN HEMISPHERE OF RECENT X-RAY IMAGES. A FILAMENT NEAR
S19E33 FADED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 01/1440-1820Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
GENERALLY LOW. THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE FROM REGION 7742 REMAINS. THE NEW REGION AT THE
EAST LIMB MAY ALSO SLIGHTLY INCREASE ACTIVITY LEVELS.

MOSTLY AT MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS.
