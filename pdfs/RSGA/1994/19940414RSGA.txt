JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 104 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 APR 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. CERTAINLY THE MOST
INTERESTING EVENT OF THE DAY ESCAPED DETECTION IN H-ALPHA AND
SOFT X-RAYS, BUT WAS DRAMATIC IN X-RAY IMAGERY. A LARGE
VOLUME OF THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST QUADRANT WAS SEEN TO DRAMATICALLY
RESTRUCTURE DURING THE FIRST 5-6 HOURS OF THE DAY. THIS
EVENT SUGGESTS A LARGE-SCALE CORONAL MASS EJECTION, EXTENDING TO
NEAR THE ECLIPTIC PLANE. JUST A VERY SMALL FILAMENT DISAPPEARED
AS PART OF THE EVENT. ELSEWHERE, LITTLE FLARE ACTIVITY OCCURRED.
ONE NEW REGION, 7701 (N05E77), ROTATED INTO VIEW AS A MATURE
SUNSPOT.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD VARIED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS. NIGHTTIME SUBSTORMS CONTINUE. THE
GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON FLUENCE WAS VERY HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE INCREASINGLY MORE DISTURBED THROUGH THE
INTERVAL. EFFECTS OF TODAY'S CME ARE DUE TO BEGIN MIDWAY
THROUGH THE INTERVAL, CULMINATING IN MINOR STORM CONDITIONS
ON APRIL 17.
