JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 241 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY INCREASED TO LOW LEVELS. A NEW
REGION IS AT THE EAST LIMB NEAR S07. THIS REGION IS THE LIKELY
SOURCE OF MULTIPLE C-CLASS FLARES - THE LARGEST WAS A C7 AT
29/1247Z. FREQUENT OPTICAL SURGING WAS OBSERVED FROM THIS SITE.
THIS AREA IS ALSO MODERATELY LARGE AND BRIGHT IN YOHKOH IMAGERY.
THIS IS A NEW REGION FROM LAST ROTATION AND IS LIKELY IN A
GROWTH STAGE. A SMALL NEW HIGH LATITUDE REGION EMERGED AT
S23E06 AND WAS NUMBERED AS NEW REGION 7772.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A LOW LEVEL WITH M-CLASS FLARES A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY.
A MORE CONFIDENT ASSESSMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE WHEN THE REGION
AT THE EAST LIMB ROTATES INTO VIEW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET. BRIEF UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT SOME SITES BETWEEN 0600-0900Z.
ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES WERE AT LOW TO MODERATE LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD CONTINUE AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS.
