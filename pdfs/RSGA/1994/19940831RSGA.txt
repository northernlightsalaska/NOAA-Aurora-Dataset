JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 243 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY RETURNED TO A LOW LEVEL. REGION
7773 (S08E61) PRODUCED FREQUENT C-CLASS FLARES. SOME REAL
GROWTH OCCURRED (NOT JUST LACK OF FORESHORTENING) IN THIS
REGION. MIXED MAGNETIC POLARITIES WERE VISIBLE IN THE CENTER
OF THE REGION AND A WEAK DELTA MAY BE FORMING THERE. HOWEVER,
THE REGION IS BASICALLY BIPOLAR. TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD,
THE BACKGROUND X-RAY FLUX WAS DECREASING WHICH INDICATES A
SLIGHT COOLING OF REGION 7773.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE LOW TO
MODERATE. REGION 7773 RETAINS THE CAPABILITY OF PRODUCING
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARES. AN X-CLASS FLARE FROM THIS REGION IS
A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY. OLD REGION 7765 IS DUE BACK TO THE EAST
LIMB ON 03 SEP. THIS REGION PRODUCED 5 M-CLASS AND 10 C-CLASS
FLARES LAST ROTATION BUT WAS DECAYING IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE
AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE AS ACTIVE THIS ROTATION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 31/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET DURING THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS.
