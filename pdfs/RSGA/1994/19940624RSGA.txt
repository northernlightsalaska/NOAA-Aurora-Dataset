IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 23/2100Z TO 24/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX (GT 2 MEV) WAS AT MODERATE
TO HIGH LEVELS OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS MAY
EXPERIENCE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS
BECAUSE OF THE REMNANT OF A LARGE, RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE. THE
HOLE APPEARS TO HAVE MOSTLY CLOSED THIS ROTATION AFTER SEVEN
ROTATIONS OF GEO-EFFECTIVENESS.
