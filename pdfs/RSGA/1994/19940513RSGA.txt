IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. ONLY A SINGLE
B5/SF FLARE IN SPOTLESS REGION 7719 (S07W56) WITH AN ASSOCIATED
SMALL DISAPPEARING FILAMENT WAS NOTED. REGION 7722 (N07E52)
GREW SLIGHTLY BUT REMAINS MAGNETICALLY SIMPLE. REGIONS 7724

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7722 HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF PRODUCING C-CLASS
ACTIVITY AND A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX
(GT 2 MEV) REMAINED AT HIGH LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 18 HOURS,
BECOMING UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE THEREAFTER DUE TO A WELL
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
