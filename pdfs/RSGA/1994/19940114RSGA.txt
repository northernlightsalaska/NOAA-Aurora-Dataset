IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY BECAME LOW. REGION 7648 (N07W79)
PRODUCED A C1/SF AT 0916Z. ANOTHER C1 OCCURRED AT 1612Z AND WAS
COINCIDENT IN TIME WITH THE BEGINNING OF AN ACTIVE SURGE

IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
GENERALLY LOW WITH THE EMPHASIS SHIFTING FROM THE WEST LIMB
TO THE NEW REGION AT THE EAST LIMB. DUE TO THE LACK OF
FREQUENT BURST ACTIVITY, IT IS LIKELY OLD REGION 7640 WILL
NOT BE AS ACTIVE THIS ROTATION AS IT WAS LAST ROTATION.
