JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 192 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 JUL 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW.  ACTIVITY THIS PERIOD
CONSISTED OF 2 WEAK OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED B-CLASS X-RAY EVENTS
AND A B6/SF FROM REGION 7749 (S09W53) OCCURRING AT 11/1002Z.
IN WHITE LIGHT, THIS REGION HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY WHILE OVERALL
SPOT COUNT HAS DECLINED.  JUST TO THE SOUTH, REGION 7750
(S17W55) HAS SHOWN THE MOST GROWTH OF ANY REGION ON THE DISK.
THOUGH STACKED, BOTH REGIONS MAINTAIN A SIMPLE NORTH TO SOUTH
MAGNETIC INVERSION LINE SO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY QUIET THE PAST 24
HOURS.  REGION 7746 (N11W44) ALSO INDICATED SOME GROWTH THIS
PERIOD IN BOTH AREAL COVERAGE, SPOT COUNT AND MAG COMPLEXITY.
YESTERDAY, 7746 HAD THREE DISTINCT PENUMBRAL AREAS BUT HAS SINCE
LOST THE PENUMBRA AROUND THE LEADER SPOT GROUP WHILE FORMING A
DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION IN THE TRAILER GROUP.  REGION 7753
(S12E68) WAS NUMBERED AS A SIMPLE AXX GROUP.  THE REMAINDER OF
THE DISK AND LIMB WAS QUIET AND STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  BOTH REGIONS 7746 AND 7750 DISPLAY GOOD POTENTIAL FOR
C-CLASS AND POSSIBLE M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.  THE GT 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX WAS AT NORMAL
TO MODERATE LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS.
