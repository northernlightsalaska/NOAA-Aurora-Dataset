JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 301 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 28 OCT 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY CONTINUED AT A VERY LOW LEVEL.
REGION 7794 (N16E36) PRODUCED A SMALL B-CLASS SUBFLARE. HOWEVER,
GROWTH OCCURRED IN THE INTERIOR AND TRAILER SPOTS DURING THE
PERIOD. MAGNETICALLY, THIS REGION REMAINED BASICALLY BIPOLAR
WITH SOME NEUTRAL LINE KINKS IN THE TRAILER.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BECOME
MOSTLY LOW WITH REGION 7794 BEGINNING TO PRODUCE C-CLASS
FLARES. ISOLATED M-CLASS EVENTS ARE POSSIBLE FROM THIS
REGION SHOULD GROWTH CONTINUE AND/OR MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY
DEVELOP.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 27/2100Z TO 28/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED. IT IS
UNLIKELY THAT THE CORONAL MASS EJECTION RELATED DISTURBANCE
WILL MATERIALIZE AT THIS LATE TIME. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES
WERE AT MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS DURING THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR MOST OF 29 OCT. A RECURRENT
CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN LATE
ON 29 OCT OR EARLY ON 30 OCT AND CONTINUE THROUGH 03 NOV.
MOSTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST DURING THAT TIME BUT
OCCASIONAL MINOR STORM AND ISOLATED MAJOR STORM INTERVALS
ARE POSSIBLE DURING THAT PERIOD.
