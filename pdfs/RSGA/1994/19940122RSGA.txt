SDF NUMBER 022 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 JAN 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS.
REGION 7654 (N09W06) PRODUCED THE ONLY C-CLASS X-RAY EVENT
OBSERVED BUT HAS LOST ITS DELTA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. TWO NEW
REGIONS WERE NUMBERED. REGION 7658 (N12E16) IS A SIMPLE BIPOLAR
GROUP. REGION 7659 (S13E47) WAS SPOTTED BRIEFLY BUT IS PRESENTLY
ONLY PLAGE AND AN ARCH FILAMENT SYSTEM. SEVERAL UNASSOCIATED
TYPE III RADIO SWEEPS, AND DISCRETE RADIO BURSTS WERE REPORTED.
A LARGE, INACTIVE PROMINENCE IS ROTATING OVER THE EAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7654 RETAINS THE POTENTIAL FOR OCCASIONAL ERUPTIVE
FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS AT
MIDDLE GEOMAGNETIC LATITUDES FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. SOME
PERIODS AT ACTIVE LEVELS WERE OBSERVED AT AURORAL LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS
ARE POSSIBLE ON 26 JAN IN RESPONSE TO DISTURBED SOLAR WIND
ASSOCIATED WITH A FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE ON 21 JAN AND AN
EQUATORIAL CORONAL HOLE WHICH WILL BE NEAR CENTRAL MERIDIAN
ON 23 JAN.
