JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 191 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 10 JUL 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 09/2100Z
TO 10/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW.  REGION 7746 (N12W30)
DECAYED SLIGHTLY IN WHITE LIGHT OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THE
REGION DISPLAYS THREE NEARLY-EQUAL PENUMBRAL AREAS WITH THE
TRAILER POLARITY BETWEEN THE TWO LARGER AND DARKER PENUMBRAL
AREAS.  REGION 7749 (S08W39) HAD SOME GROWTH THIS PERIOD.  7749
ACCOUNTED FOR TWO B-CLASS/SF FLARES WITH THE LARGEST, A B7,
OCCURRING AT 10/0342Z.  SIX OTHER UNCORRELATED WEAK B-CLASS
X-RAY EVENTS WERE REPORTED AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD.  NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY WAS REPORTED.  THREE
NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED THIS PERIOD.  REGION 7750 (S16W40)
AND REGION 7751 (S12E57) EMERGED AS BXO BETA GROUPS.  REGION
7752 (N21W01) APPEARED AS A FAINT TWO-SPOT AXX GROUP BUT SINCE
ITS NUMBERING, HAS DECAYED TO A SMALL, COMPACT AREA OF PLAGE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  DESPITE ITS SLIGHT DECAY, REGION 7746 STILL DISPLAYS
GOOD POTENTIAL FOR C-CLASS AND POSSIBLE M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
ANOTHER AREA WITH GOOD C AND POSSIBLE M-CLASS POTENTIAL IS THE
TWO REGION COMPLEX 7749 AND 7750.  THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY COULD
PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 09/2100Z TO 10/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.  THE GT 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX WAS AT NORMAL
TO MODERATE LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
