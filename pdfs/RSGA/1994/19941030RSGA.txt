JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 303 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 OCT 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. REGION 7794 (N13E09)
DECAYED SLIGHTLY AND PRODUCED SEVERAL MINOR SUBFLARES. A SMALL
REGION EMERGED NEAR S17W23 AND WAS NUMBERED AS NEW REGION 7799.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BECOME
LOW AS REGION 7794 IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING OCCASIONAL
C-CLASS FLARES. THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS REGION PRODUCING AN
M-CLASS FLARE IS DIMINISHING.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD BEGAN THE PERIOD AT UNSETTLED LEVELS.
AFTER 30/0300Z, ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS BEGAN
AND CONTINUED FOR MOST OF THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
MAJOR STORMING WAS OBSERVED IN PLANETARY INDICES BETWEEN
30/0900-1200Z. THE CHARACTER AND TIMING OF THIS DISTURBANCE
ARGUE STRONGLY THAT THE EXPECTED CORONAL HOLE RELATED
DISTURBANCE HAS ARRIVED. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES WERE AT
NORMAL BACKGROUND LEVELS UNTIL NEAR 30/1500Z WHEN A RAPID
RISE TO MOSTLY HIGH LEVELS WAS OBSERVED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT MOSTLY ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE
NEXT THREE DAYS. OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF MAJOR STORMING ARE
POSSIBLE.
