JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 078 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 19 MAR 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 18/2100Z
TO 19/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. JUST ONE SIMPLE
SPOT GROUP, 7692 (N19E19), REMAINS. THE NORTHERNMOST 8 DEGREES
OF THE LARGE DIAGONALLY-ORIENTED FILAMENT IN THE WESTERN
HEMISPHERE DISAPPEARED DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY. A
PROMINENCE LOCATED NEAR N21E90 WAS SEEN TO ERUPT AT 0633Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AT VERY LOW LEVELS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 18/2100Z TO 19/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. NIGHTTIME SUBSTORMS HAVE WEAKENED.
THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON EVENT IS DECLINING, WITH
PEAK VALUES OF NEAR 1.0E+04 OBSERVED DURING THE DAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED THE FIRST HALF OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE SHOULD
SEND HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND THIS WAY THE LATTER PART OF THE
INTERVAL. ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED
THEN.

PLANNING FOR FUTURE SOLAR OPTICAL AND SOLAR RADIO
OBSERVATIONS IS IN PROGRESS. CONSIDERATION IS BEING GIVEN
TO HAVING NO REGULAR SOLAR ACTIVITY PATROL IN THE OPTICAL
AND RADIO WAVELENGTHS. THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF NO
SYNOPTIC IMAGES. CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO US ANY CRITICAL
IMPACTS SUCH ACTIONS WOULD HAVE ON YOUR OPERATIONS OR
RESEARCH?  PLEASE REPLY TO SESC NO LATER THAN 23 MARCH 1994.
