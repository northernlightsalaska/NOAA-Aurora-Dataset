BETA WITH TWO SPOTS TO A EAI BETA-GAMMA WITH 21 SPOTS.  THIS
PERIOD, RGN 7811 PRODUCED THREE C-CLASS FLARES.  THE LARGEST
EVENT WAS A C2/0N WHICH MAXED AT 26/2023Z.  NUMEROUS LOWER
FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS WERE ALSO OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD. THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS A BURST OF 1800SFU OBSERVED
ON 245 MHZ AT 26/1849Z.  THIS BURST WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A B8/SF

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  LEVELS ROSE DRAMATICALLY
TO STORM CONDITIONS ABOUT 26/1030Z AND HAS REMAINED AT MINOR
TO SEVERE LEVELS SINCE.  THIS ACTIVITY IS BELIEVED TO BE IN
RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE
FEATURE.  THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ALTITUDES WAS MOSTLY NORMAL WITH MODERATE
LEVELS EARLY IN THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS FOR
THE NEXT 48 HOURS.  LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO MOSTLY
