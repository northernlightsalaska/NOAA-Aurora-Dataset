JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 017 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 JAN 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  REGION 7654 (N08E55)
PRODUCED TWO IMPRESSIVE FLARES LAST NIGHT.  THE FIRST WAS AN
M6/1N WHICH PEAKED AT 16/2325Z.  OPTICAL REPORTS INDICATED A
Y-SHAPED RIBBON CHARACTERISTIC WITH THE FLARE.  RADIO EMISSION
RAN FROM 245MHZ TO 15400MHZ TO INCLUDE A 190SFU TENFLARE AND
2.2E+05 START-TO-PEAK INTEGRATED FLUX FROM 8800MHZ.  A TYPE II
SWEEP WITH AN ESTIMATED SHOCK VELOCITY OF 400 KM/SEC WAS ALSO
REPORTED.  THE SECOND FLARE WAS A C9/1N WITH WEAK RADIO EMISSION
IN THE UPPER WAVELENGTHS.  THIS FLARE PEAKED AT 17/0919Z.
WEAKER C-CLASS FLARING HAS OCCURRED SINCE THE C9.  REGION 7654
HAS SHOWN SOME GROWTH IN PAST 24 HOURS WHILE MAINTAINING A
RELATIVELY COMPLEX INVERSION LINE.  THE OTHER SPOTTED REGION
7652 (N04E42) HAS BEEN STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS FORECAST TO
BE LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 7654 SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRODUCE
C-CLASS AND SOME M-CLASS ACTIVITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS IN
THE MIDDLE LATITUDES FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  HIGH LATITUDES
HAVE BEEN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS WITH SOME MINOR STORMING.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
