JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 079 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 MAR 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. REGION 7692 (N18E06)
IS THE ONLY REGION VISIBLE. NO ACTIVITY OF ANY TYPE WAS
REPORTED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. THE GREATER THAN
2 MEV ELECTRON FLUXES CONTINUE TO HOVER NEAR 1.0E+04.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO MILDLY ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT 24
HOURS. HIGH SPEED SOLAR WIND FROM A WELL-LOCATED CORONAL
HOLE IS DUE EARLY ON 22 MARCH. THIS DISTURBANCE SHOULD SLOWLY
WEAKEN BY THE END OF THE INTERVAL.

PLANNING FOR FUTURE SOLAR OPTICAL AND SOLAR RADIO
OBSERVATIONS IS IN PROGRESS. CONSIDERATION IS BEING GIVEN
TO HAVING NO REGULAR SOLAR ACTIVITY PATROL IN THE OPTICAL
AND RADIO WAVELENGTHS. THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF NO
SYNOPTIC IMAGES. CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO US ANY CRITICAL
IMPACTS SUCH ACTIONS WOULD HAVE ON YOUR OPERATIONS OR
RESEARCH?  PLEASE REPLY TO SESC NO LATER THAN 23 MARCH 1994.
