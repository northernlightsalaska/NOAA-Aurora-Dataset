JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 143 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 MAY 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY CONTINUED AT A VERY LOW LEVEL. THE
CURRENT DISK REGIONS EXHIBITED LITTLE EVOLUTION. THE EASTERN
HEMISPHERE OF THE SUN IS NEARLY DEVOID OF FEATURES EXCEPT FOR
A LARGE CORONAL HOLE IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT. THE LEADING
EDGE OF THIS RECURRENT HOLE IS APPROXIMATELY ONE DAY BEHIND
WHERE IT WAS LOCATED LAST ROTATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT VERY LOW LEVELS FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. NO REGIONS ARE
DUE TO RETURN TO THE EAST LIMB DURING THAT TIME.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET AT MID LATITUDES AND QUIET TO
SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED AT HIGH LATITUDES. ENERGETIC ELECTRON
FLUXES REMAINED AT MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS. IT IS UNUSUAL FOR
THESE FLUXES TO REMAIN ENHANCED AFTER THREE DAYS OF QUIET
GEOMAGNETIC FIELD CONDITIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE DURATION OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT CORONAL HOLE DISTURBANCE IS
EXPECTED TO BEGIN ON 29 MAY. THIS IS 28 DAYS AFTER THE
ONSET OF THE LAST STORM FROM THIS HOLE. THE TIMING OF THIS
FORECAST IS BASED UPON THE APPARENT SLOWER ROTATION RATE OF
THIS HOLE.
