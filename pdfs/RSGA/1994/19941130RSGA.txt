JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 334 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 NOV 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. REGION 7811 (S17W68)
RE-DEVELOPED INTO A DAO SPOT GROUP AND PRODUCED NINE B-CLASS
FLARES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS A B7/SF FLARE AT 30/1930Z. THIS
IS THE ONLY SPOTTED REGION ON THE DISK AT THIS TIME.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW TO LOW. REGION 7811 HAS A FAIR CHANCE OF PRODUCING
ISOLATED C-CLASS FLARE ACTIVITY AND AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS EXPERIENCED
A SHORT PERIOD OF MAJOR STORMING FROM 30/0900 TO 30/1200Z.
ACTIVITY WAS MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF A POSSIBLE CORONAL
MASS EJECTION AS INDICATED BY AN IMPULSIVE C2/1N FLARE WITH
A TYPE II SWEEP ON 27/1617Z. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC
ELECTRON FLUX AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ALTITUDES WAS MODERATE TO
HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE FIRST DAY AND A HALF
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL
HOLE. ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS MAY SEE SHORT
PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING, ESPECIALLY DURING LOCAL
NIGHTTIME, FOR THE NEXT 36 HOURS.
