JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 039 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 08 FEB 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED VERY LOW. NEW REGION 7668
(N09E50) EMERGED RAPIDLY AND PRODUCED SEVERAL OPTICAL FLARES
WITH B-CLASS ENHANCEMENTS. REGION 7664 (S14W62), WHICH WAS
GROWING RAPIDLY ON 07 FEB, STABILIZED DURING THE PERIOD.
A LACK OF DATA IS INHIBITING ANALYSIS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BECOME
GENERALLY LOW. REGION 7668 IS BECOMING A LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR
LOW C-CLASS SUBFLARES. OLD REGION 7654 IS DUE AT THE EAST
LIMB AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND SHOULD START TO ELEVATE
ACTIVITY LEVELS AT THAT TIME. LAST ROTATION, REGION 7654
PRODUCED FOUR M-CLASS AND MANY C-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.
SOME HIGH LATITUDE SITES EXPERIENCED SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS.
THE SEVERITY OF THIS DISTURBANCE APPEARED TO BE MODERATING
TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD. MORE FREQUENT ACTIVE TO
UNSETTLED K INDICES WERE OBSERVED AT VARIOUS OBSERVATORIES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BECOME PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE FOR THE DURATION OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. OCCASIONAL MINOR TO MAJOR STORM PERIODS ARE
LIKELY. THE CORONAL HOLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DISTURBANCE IS
QUITE ELONGATED AND DISTURBED GEOMAGNETIC CONDITIONS SHOULD
BE EXPECTED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK.
