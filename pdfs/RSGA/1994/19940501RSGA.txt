IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. THERE WERE NUMEROUS
SMALL ERUPTING FLUX REGIONS ON THE DISK DURING THE PERIOD:
AMONGST THESE NEW REGION  7715 (N08W29) WAS DEVELOPING THE
MOST QUICKLY. ALL OF THE REGIONS ON THE DISK APPEAR TO BE
STABLE AT THIS TIME. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED ON

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 30/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY QUIET TO ACTIVE WITH SOME
PERIODS OF STORM CONDITIONS AT HIGH LATITUDES. AN INITIALLY
QUIET FIELD BECAME DISTURBED AFTER 0600Z: MID-LATITUDES HAVE
BEEN ACTIVE AND HIGH LATITUDES HAVE FLUCTUATED BETWEEN ACTIVE
AND MAJOR STORM LEVELS. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE FOR THE DIS-
TURBANCE IS A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
36 TO 48 HOURS AS THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE CONTINUES. ACTIVITY
