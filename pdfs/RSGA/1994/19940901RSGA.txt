JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 244 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 01 SEP 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY CONTINUED AT A LOW LEVEL. SEVERAL
LOW C-CLASS FLARES WERE PRODUCED BY REGION 7773 (S08E49).
MAGNETIC DATA TODAY INDICATE A BIPOLAR CONFIGURATION IN THIS
REGION. THERE ARE SOME MIXED FIELDS IN THE CENTER OF THE
REGION BUT THEY ARE WEAK. GROWTH APPEARED TO HAVE SLOWED OR
CEASED AND SUBFLARE PRODUCTION WAS DOWN FROM PREVIOUS DAYS.
A NEW REGION IS VISIBLE IN X-RAYS AT THE EAST LIMB NEAR N15.
ALSO, A BROAD AREA OF X-RAY EMISSION IS VISIBLE ABOVE THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB WHERE OLD REGION 7765 IS DUE ON 03 SEP. A
CORONAL HOLE IS VISIBLE IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT. LAST
ROTATION, THIS HOLE WAS OF SIMILAR SHAPE BUT CLOSER TO THE
EQUATOR.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
MOSTLY LOW. AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE FROM REGION 7773
REMAINS A POSSIBILITY BUT AT A REDUCED PROBABILITY. LITTLE
IS KNOWN ABOUT THE REGIONS AT OR NEAR THE EAST LIMB. AT
THIS TIME, C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM THESE LOCATIONS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
EARLY IN THE PERIOD (31/2100-2400Z) THE FIELD BECAME
UNSETTLED. BETWEEN 01/0000-0300Z ACTIVE LEVELS WERE OBSERVED.
THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED.
THE SOURCE OF THIS BRIEF DISTURBANCE IS UNKNOWN.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
A RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN
AROUND 06 SEP.
