JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 226 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE DURING THE PAST 24
HOURS. REGION 7765 (S10W10) PRODUCED AN M3/1N FLARE MAXING AT
14/1738. THE FLARE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY RADIO BURSTS INCLUDING
210 FLUX UNITS AT 2695 MHZ (A TENFLARE OF 7 MINUTES DURATION)
AND 170 FLUX UNITS AT 245 MHZ. SIX OTHER C-CLASS X-RAYS EVENTS
WERE OBSERVED FROM 7765 DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD. 7765 IS
NOW EXTREMELY MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX (BETA GAMMA DELTA) AND HAS
DOUBLED IN WHITE LIGHT SINCE YESTERDAY. NEW REGION 7766 (N10E47)
EMERGED ON THE DISK AS A SMALL C-TYPE GROUP. SURGING WAS
REPORTED ON THE WEST LIMB NEAR N06, THE LOCATION OF DEPARTING
REGION 7762.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. HOWEVER, REGION 7765 IS CAPABLE OF ADDITIONAL MODERATE
(M-CLASS) X-RAY FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY ACTIVE WITH SOME
PERIODS AT MINOR STORM LEVELS. THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURBANCE
IS UNKNOWN. HIGH FLUXES OF ENERGETIC ELECTRONS HAVE BEEN
MEASURED AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS SATELLITE ALTITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT ACTIVE LEVELS TOMORROW, DECLINING
TOWARD UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ON THE 16TH. A CORONAL MASS EJECTION
POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH TODAY'S M3 TENFLARE COULD ARRIVE
LATE ON THE 16TH OR EARLY ON THE 17TH, RESULTING IN RESUMED
ACTIVE GEOMAGNETIC CONDITIONS BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
