SDF NUMBER 284 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 OCT 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED VERY LOW. REGION 7789
(N08E45) IS GROWING AND HAS SOME MIXED POLARITIES. NEW REGION
7790 (N12E78) ROTATED ONTO THE DISK AS A MODERATE SIZE H CLASS

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM. THIS
DISTURBANCE WAS UNEXPECTED BUT IS PROBABLY DUE TO A CORONAL
HOLE IN THE SOUTHWEST WHICH HAD A WEAK SIGNITURE IN HE 10830
SPECTROHELIOGRAMS. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES BEGAN THE PERIOD
AT HIGH LEVELS THEN DROPPED TO MODERATE LEVELS AND LATE IN
THE PERIOD RETURNED TO HIGH LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS DUE TO THE CORONAL HOLE IN THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.
PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING ARE PROBABLE DURING THAT TIME,
ESPECIALLY AT HIGH LATITUDES.
