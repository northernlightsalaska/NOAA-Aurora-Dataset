TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW.  THREE WEAK B-CLASS
XRAY EVENTS WERE RECORDED THIS PERIOD.  REGION 7685 (S08W04) HAS
SHOWN SLIGHT WHITE LIGHT GROWTH WHILE INDICATING SOME TRAILER
PENUMBRA DECAY.  REGION 7687 (N18E03) ELONGATED SLIGHTLY ALONG A
E-W AXIS THIS PERIOD.  ALL OTHER REGIONS QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW TO LOW WITH REGIONS 7685 AND 7687 THE MOST LIKELY TO
PRODUCE C-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS UNTIL 07/03Z WHEN THE FIELD BECAME DISTURBED.
CONDITIONS SINCE 07/03Z HAVE BEEN MOSTLY ACTIVE TO MINOR
STORM AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM AT HIGH
LATITUDES.  PERIODS OF SEVERE STORM LEVELS WERE RECORDED AT
07/18Z AT HIGH LATITUDES.  THIS GEOMAGNETIC STORM IS BELIEVED
TO BE CAUSED BY A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE.
RECURRENCE INDICATES THIS HOLE HAS PERSISTED FOR SEVERAL
ROTATIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN DISTURBED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS
FORECAST PERIOD.  ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WITH
