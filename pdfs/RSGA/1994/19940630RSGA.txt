JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 181 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 30 JUN 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY BECAME LOW DUE TO SEVERAL SMALL
C-CLASS FLARES FROM REGION 7742 (S08E29). THIS REGION EXHIBITED
MODERATE GROWTH BUT THE WEAK DELTA CONFIGURATION WAS NOT VISIBLE
DURING THE PERIOD. BIG BEAR OBSERVATORY REPORTS THERE IS LITTLE
SHEAR IN THIS REGION. NEARBY REGION 7743 (S11E41) WAS GENERALLY
STABLE BUT SOME ENHANCEMENTS IN REGION 7742 COINCIDED WITH
POINT BRIGHTENINGS IN REGION 7743. A SMALL REGION EMERGED NEAR
S16W04 AND WAS NUMBERED AS REGION 7744. (NOTE AT PRESS TIME:
REGION 7742 PRODUCED AN M2 FLARE AT 30/2124Z.)
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
GENERALLY LOW. INTERMITTENT C-CLASS FLARES ARE EXPECTED FROM
REGION 7742 WITH AN ISOLATED CHANCE OF A SMALL M-CLASS FLARE
SHOULD GROWTH CONTINUE AND/OR MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY REAPPEAR.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS. LOCAL NIGHTTIMES WERE THE MOST DISTURBED PERIODS.
THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV FLUXES WERE AT MODERATE LEVELS
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD. HIGH FLUXES WERE
OBSERVED DURING THE LATTER HALF.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
