JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 035 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 FEB 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW WITH ONLY SMALL
B-CLASS BURSTS OBSERVED. REGION 7666 (N17E37) GREW SLIGHTLY.
NEW SPOTS EMERGED IN THE PLAGE OF REGION 7664 (S12W09). YOHKOH
IMAGES SHOW THE SOUTHERN CORONAL HOLE AS SIMILAR TO LAST
ROTATION WITH A SLIGHT EQUATORWARD EXPANSION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE AT A
VERY LOW TO LOW LEVEL FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUIET. SOME HIGH
LATITUDE STATIONS EXPERIENCED ISOLATED ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS BUT THIS LEVEL OF DISTURBANCE WAS NOT OBSERVED
GLOBALLY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE MOSTLY QUIET FOR 05 FEB. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE
FORECAST FOR 06 FEB. BEGINNING ON 07 FEB, THE CORONAL HOLE
RELATED DISTURBANCE EXPERIENCED LAST ROTATION SHOULD RECUR.
THIS LONG-LIVED DISTURBANCE RESULTED IN DAILY A INDICES IN
THE ACTIVE RANGE WITH SOME K INDICES IN THE MINOR TO SEVERE
STORM RANGE. SIMILAR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THIS ROTATION.
THE MODERATE TO HIGH FLUXES OF ENERGETIC ELECTRONS OBSERVED
WITH THIS DISTURBANCE LAST ROTATION SHOULD ALSO RECUR.
