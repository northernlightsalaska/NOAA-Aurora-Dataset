JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 228 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 16 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A
SINGLE C-CLASS X-RAY EVENT OCCURRED AT 1327Z (MAX) BUT NO FLARE
REPORT WAS RECEIVED. REGION 7765 (S11W37) WAS THE LIKELY SOURCE
BECAUSE IT PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES THROUGH THE DAY, MANY WITH
X-RAY ENHANCEMENTS. REGION 7765 CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN WHITE
LIGHT AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY.  NEW REGION 7767 (S13E47) EMERGED
AS A SIMPLE, BIPOLAR SPOT GROUP. THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK AND
LIMBS WERE QUIET.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO VERY LOW. REGION 7765 NOW APPEARS CAPABLE OF ONLY
ISOLATED C-CLASS X-RAY EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT WERE HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE TOMORROW BASED ON A POSSIBLE SOLAR WIND
DISTURBANCE ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERATE X-RAY EVENT ON 14 AUGUST.
QUIET TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
