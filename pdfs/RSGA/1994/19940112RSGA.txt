JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 012 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 JAN 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW WITH ONLY MINOR
B-CLASS ENHANCEMENTS OBSERVED. SEVERAL OBSERVATORIES REPORTED
THAT THE TRAILER SPOT OF REGION 7648 (N07W54) MERGED WITH THE
LEADER SPOT OF REGION 7650 (N05W41). THIS TECHNICALLY RESULTS
IN THE FORMATION OF A DELTA CONFIGURATION BUT APPARENTLY THERE
IS LITTLE SHEAR IN THE AREA AS EVIDENCED BY THE LACK OF BURST
ACTIVITY. A SMALL CLASS C GROUP EMERGED AT S06W18 AND WAS
NUMBERED AS NEW REGION 7651.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE AT A
VERY LOW TO LOW LEVEL. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AN M-CLASS
FLARE FROM THE 7648/7650 COMPLEX BUT THAT POSSIBILITY IS
DIMINISHED. OLD REGION 7640 IS DUE TO RETURN TO THE EAST LIMB
NEAR N08 ON 15 JAN. THIS REGION PRODUCED 7 M-CLASS AND 62
C-CLASS FLARES LAST ROTATION AND FADED FROM VIEW AS A LARGE
REGION WITH MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. THIS REGION COULD RETURN AS
AN M-CLASS FLARE PRODUCER.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOME HIGH
LATITUDE SITES EXPERIENCED MINOR TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS
DURING THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE FOR 13-14 JAN AS THE
CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE SUBSIDES. ISOLATED STORM
CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE DURING THAT PERIOD. MOSTLY
UNSETTLED LEVELS ARE FORECAST FOR 15 JAN.
