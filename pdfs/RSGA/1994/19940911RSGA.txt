JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 254 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 SEP 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7773 (S07W92)
PRODUCED A LONG DURATION C8/SF FLARE AT 11/0505Z. THIS FLARE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY A WEAK TYPE II SWEEP BURST AND A LOOP PROMINENCE
SYSTEM. ACTIVE SURGING WAS OBSERVED WITHIN THE REGION THROUGHOUT
THE PERIOD. THE REMAINING REGIONS WERE STABLE. NEW REGION 7778
(S06W53) WAS ASSIGNED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW TO LOW. REGION 7773 COULD PRODUCE A C-CLASS FLARE FROM
BEYOND THE WEST LIMB.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS AT MIDDLE LATITUDES. HIGH LATITUDE
CONDITIONS RANGED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS. THE
STORMING OCCURRED FROM 11/0600-1500Z AND WAS PROBABLY DUE TO
CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS. A GT 10 MEV PROTON ENHANCEMENT FOLLOWED
THE LONG DURATION FLARE MENTIONED ABOVE. THE ENHANCEMENT
BEGAN NEAR 11/0700Z, REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 1.2 PFU AT
11/0935Z, AND RETURNED TO BACKGROUND LEVELS NEAR 11/1300Z.
THE GT 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX WAS IN THE HIGH RANGE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS DURING THE FIRST
TWO DAYS. BRIEF PERIODS OF ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS ARE
ALSO POSSIBLE AT HIGH LATITUDES DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIMES. THE
FIELD IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS
ON THE THIRD DAY IN RESPONSE TO THE LONG DURATION C8/SF FLARE
MENTIONED ABOVE. PERIODS OF MAJOR STORMING WILL BE POSSIBLE
AT HIGHER LATITUDES. AN ISOLATED SOUTHERN HEMISPHERIC CORONAL
HOLE MAY AFFECT THE FIELD DURING THE FINAL DAY AS WELL.
