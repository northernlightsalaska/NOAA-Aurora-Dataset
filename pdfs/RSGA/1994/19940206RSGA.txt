JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 037 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 06 FEB 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY CONTINUED VERY LOW. REGION 7664
(S11W34) GREW AT A MODERATE PACE AND PRODUCED TWO MID LEVEL
B-CLASS SUBFLARES. A STRONG ARCH FILAMENT SYSTEM WAS OBSERVED
HERE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A VERY LOW LEVEL. CONTINUED GROWTH IN REGION 7664 COULD
RESULT IN AN ISOLATED C-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY ACTIVE UNTIL A MAJOR
DISTURBANCE BEGAN NEAR 06/1000Z. MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS
ENSUED AT MID LATITUDES AND MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS
WERE DETECTED AT HIGH LATITUDES. A FORBUSH DECREASE OF
APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENT WAS OBSERVED NEAR 06/0600Z. THE GOES
6 SPACECRAFT AT 85W EXPERIENCED MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSINGS AT
06/1620-1632Z AND 06/1709-1713Z. THE ONLY SOURCE FOR THIS
DISTURBANCE IS A FILAMENT DISRUPTION ON 01 FEB NEAR S35E01.
THE FORBUSH DECREASE AND THE SEVERITY OF THIS DISTURBANCE
ARGUE AGAINST THE EARLY ARRIVAL OF THE CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD CONTINUE AT MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR EARLY
07 FEB. THE CORONAL HOLE STREAM SHOULD ESTABLISH ITSELF IN
THE EARTH'S VICINITY DURING 07 FEB AND GEOMAGNETIC
CONDITIONS SHOULD MODERATE SOMEWHAT. ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR 08-09 FEB. ISOLATED PERIODS AT
MAJOR STORM ARE POSSIBLE DURING THAT PERIOD FOR MID
LATITUDES AND HIGH LATITUDES COULD EXPERIENCE PERIODS AT
SEVERE STORM.
