JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 040 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 FEB 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  REGION 7668 (N08E35) WAS
THE MOST ACTIVE THIS PERIOD PRODUCING SEVERAL OPTICAL FLARES
WITH B-CLASS ENHANCEMENTS WHILE SHOWING GOOD WHITE LIGHT GROWTH.
RGN 7664 (S12W75) PRODUCED THE ONLY C-CLASS FLARE THIS PERIOD
WHICH MAXED AT 1822.  THIS RGN IS ALSO SHOWING GROWTH AS IT
APPROACHES THE WEST LIMB.  ALL OTHER REGIONS ARE STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW WITH REGIONS 7664 AND 7668 SHOWING THE MOST PROMISE FOR
C-CLASS ACTIVITY.  OLD REGION 7654 (N09, CARRINGTON 207) IS DUE
TO RETURN LATE ON THE 11TH.  DURING ITS LAST ROTATION, IT
PRODUCED 4 M-CLASS AND 27 C-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
AT MIDDLE LATITUDES, THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT ACTIVE
TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WHILE AT HIGH LATITUDES, THE FIELD HAS
BEEN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS WITH ISOLATED
SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS REPORTED.  A FAVORABLY POSITIONED
CORONAL HOLE IS BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STORM
CONDITIONS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD REMAIN AT MOSTLY ACTIVE LEVELS FOR THE DURATION OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR
STORMS ARE STILL LIKELY.  DISTURBED GEOMAGNETIC CONDITIONS
SHOULD BE EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT SIX DAYS.
