JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 051 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 FEB 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7671 (N09W15)
PRODUCED AN M4/3B FLARE EARLY IN THE PERIOD. THE EVENT ATTAINED
MAXIMUM AT 0141Z, AND INCLUDED TYPES II AND IV SWEEP, AS WELL
AS A BURST OF 190 SFU AT 2695 MHZ. THE LARGE CIRCULAR FILAMENT
LOCATED AT THE PERIMETER OF THE REGION OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS,
DISAPPEARED DURING THE ACTIVITY, AND THE MAIN SPOT HAS SINCE
FRAGMENTED INTO AT LEAST TWO PIECES. SINCE THIS IMPULSIVE
FLARE, THE REGION HAS DONE LITTLE OF SIGNIFICANCE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. ADDITIONAL M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS NOT EXPECTED FROM REGION
7671.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS.
A SATELLITE PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV BEGAN AT
0300Z. THIS ACTIVITY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FLARE/CME EVENT
FROM REGION 7671 AT 0141Z. A SHARP ONSET, TYPICAL OF WELL-
CONNECTED EVENTS, PRECEDED A PEAK OF 74 PFU AT 0915Z. THE
FLUXES HAVE DECAYED SLIGHTLY DURING THE DAY, BUT STILL HOVER
NEAR THE 50 PFU LEVEL. A SMALL SIGNATURE AT GREATER THAN
100 MEV WAS ALSO SEEN, ROUGHLY ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ABOVE
BACKGROUND. EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS AT THULE PROHIBIT A PRECISE
ASSESSMENT OF A POLAR CAP ABSORPTION, BUT OTHER DATA
SUGGEST IT MAY BE ON THE ORDER OF 3-4 DB. THIS IS THE FIRST
SOLAR PROTON EVENT SINCE MARCH, 1993.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
FLARE/CME EFFECTS ARE EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE LAST 48 HOURS
WHEN MINOR STORM CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL. EPISODES OF
MAJOR STORMING AT ALL LATITUDES ARE DISTINCTLY POSSIBLE.
PROTON FLUXES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO INCREASE WITH THE PASSAGE
OF A SHOCK, EXPECTED EARLY ON FEB. 22. THE SLOW DECAY IS
LIKELY TO PERSIST THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.
