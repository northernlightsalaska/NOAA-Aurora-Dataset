JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 299 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 OCT 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. HOWEVER, THE
CHARACTER OF THE DISK HAS CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE
ADDITION OF THREE NEW SPOT GROUPS IN THE SOUTHEAST. THE NEW
REGIONS ARE 7795 (S17E37), 7796 (S06E47), AND 7797 (S09E70).
ALL HAVE BEEN QUIET TO THIS POINT. REGION 7794 (N15E60) FULLY
REVEALS ITSELF TO BE A RELATIVELY LARGE AND EXTENDED GROUP WITH
A SLIGHT DEGREE OF MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. IT PRODUCED A SUBFLARE
RECENTLY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. SOME C-CLASS ACTIVITY, ESPECIALLY
FROM REGION 7794, IS LIKELY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON
FLUX REMAINED HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS BEGINNING
MIDWAY-TO-LATE ON 27 OCTOBER. A SHOCK FROM THE FLARE/CME EVENT
OF 1009Z ON 25 OCTOBER IS DUE THEN, WITH ELEVATED ACTIVITY TO
FOLLOW. THIS DISTURBANCE SHOULD SUBSIDE BY THE END OF THE
INTERVAL.
