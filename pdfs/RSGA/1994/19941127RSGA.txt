SDF NUMBER 331 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 NOV 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  REGION 7811 (S17W25)
MAINTAINED ITS EAI BETA-GAMMA CONFIGURATION WHILE PRODUCING
TWO C-CLASS X-RAY EVENTS.  THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS A C2/1N
WHICH MAXED AT 27/1617UT.  NUMEROUS REPORTS OF LOW FREQUENCY
(018 - 410 MHZ) RADIO EMMISIONS WERE DETECTED THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD.  NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY WAS REPORTED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  REGION 7811 IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE PRODUCING C-CLASS
ACTIVITY AS IT ROTATES ACROSS THE DISK.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THIS ACTIVITY IS BELIEVED TO
BE IN RESPONSE TO A FAVORABLY POSITIONED RECURRENT CORONAL
HOLE FEATURE.  THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON
FLUX AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ALTITUDES WAS MOSTLY NORMAL THROUGH
ABOUT 27/1200UT.  FLUX LEVELS STEADILY CLIMBED AFTER THAT
REACHING HIGH LEVELS ABOUT 27/1900UT.  FLUX LEVELS HAVE
REMAINED AT HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE WITH ISOLATED
PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THE
FIELD IS EXPECTED TO CALM DOWN TO MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
