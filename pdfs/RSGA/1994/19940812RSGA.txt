JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 224 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 12 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 11/2100Z
TO 12/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW DURING THE PAST 24
HOURS. HOWEVER, NEW REGION 7765 (S11E17), A MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX
D-TYPE GROUP, EMERGED RAPIDLY AFTER 12/0000Z. IT HAS PRODUCED
5 SUBFAINT FLARES, SOME WITH LOW-LEVEL X-RAY ENHANCEMENTS. TWO
OTHER H-TYPE SPOT GROUPS ARE VISIBLE ON THE DISK. A DARK
FILAMENT SEEN IN HE 1083 NM NEAR N25E25 ON 10 AUGUST WAS
CONSIDERABLY REDUCED ON TODAY'S IMAGE. THERE WERE NO REPORTS
OF ERUPTIVE LIMB ACTIVITY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW BASED ON A GOOD PROBABILITY OF C-CLASS X-RAY FLARES FROM
NEW REGION 7765. IF RAPID GROWTH CONTINUES, THERE IS A CHANCE
OF AN ISOLATED MODERATE X-RAY FLARE.
 2A.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 11/2100Z TO 12/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS, ALTHOUGH ISOLATED QUIET AND ACTIVE PERIODS WERE
ALSO OBSERVED. MODERATE LEVELS OF ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES
WERE OBSERVED AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT PRIMARILY UNSETTLED LEVELS WITH ISOLATED
PERIODS OF BOTH QUIET AND ACTIVE CONDITIONS. ENERGETIC ELECTRON
FLUXES ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE TOWARD NORMAL BACKGROUND VALUES.
