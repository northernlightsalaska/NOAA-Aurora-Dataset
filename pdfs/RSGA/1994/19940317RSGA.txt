PLANNING FOR FUTURE SOLAR OPTICAL AND SOLAR RADIO
OBSERVATIONS IS IN PROGRESS.  CONSIDERATION IS BEING GIVEN
TO HAVING NO REGULAR SOLAR ACTIVITY PATROL IN THE OPTICAL
AND RADIO WAVELENGTHS.  THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF NO
SYNOPTIC IMAGES.  CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO US ANY CRITICAL
IMPACTS SUCH ACTIONS WOULD HAVE ON YOUR OPERATIONS OR
RESEARCH.  PLEASE REPLY TO SESC NO LATER THAN 23 MARCH 1994.
