JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 282 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 09 OCT 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7785 (S09W59)
PRODUCED A C7/1N FLARE AT 09/1623Z. PRIOR TO THIS EVENT, REGION
7785 BEGAN A GROWTH PHASE AND A WEAK DELTA MAY BE FORMING IN
THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SUNSPOT REGION. THIS REGION ALSO
PRODUCED A B4/SF FLARE AT 09/0641Z THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY

(N09E71) SHOWED ITSELF AS A MODERATE AREA CLASS C SUNSPOT
GROUP. THE SPOTS IN THIS GROUP ARE NOT TIGHTLY CLUSTERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE MOSTLY
LOW. REGION 7785 IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF C-CLASS FLARES.
SHOULD GROWTH CONTINUE AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY INCREASE,
AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE IS POSSIBLE FROM THIS REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 08/2100Z TO 09/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. A FEW HIGH
LATITUDE SITES EXPERIENCED BRIEF PERIODS OF STORMING. THE
ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES REMAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD CONTINUE AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS.
