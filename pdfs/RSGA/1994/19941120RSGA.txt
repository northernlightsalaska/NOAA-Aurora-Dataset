JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 324 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 NOV 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED VERY LOW. SURGING WAS
VISIBLE NEAR NE13 AND A SMALL SPOT IS ROTATING ONTO THE VISIBLE
DISK. THIS REGION WAS NUMBERED AS NEW REGION 7810. THIS IS
NEAR WHERE OLD REGION 7794 IS DUE TO RETURN.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A VERY LOW LEVEL FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD. IT IS
DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE FLARE POTENTIAL OF REGION 7810 DUE
TO FORESHORTENING. HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF X-RAY BURSTS
OR AN INCREASE IN FULL DISK EMISSIONS ARGUE FOR A BENIGN
REGION AT THAT LOCATION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD VARIED BETWEEN QUIET AND MAJOR STORM
LEVELS. THE MOST DISTURBED PERIOD WAS BETWEEN 20/0600-
1200Z. MID AND HIGH LATITUDE SITES EXPERIENCED MAJOR STORM
CONDITIONS DURING THAT INTERVAL.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE EARLY
PART OF 21 NOV. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR 22
NOV. THE FIELD SHOULD BECOME QUIET TO UNSETTLED ON 23 NOV.
