JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 302 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 OCT 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY BECAME LOW DUE TO A C1/SF FLARE
AT 29/0437Z FROM REGION 7794 (N15E22). THIS REGION STABILIZED
AND ONLY MINOR MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY WAS OBSERVED. A SMALL H
CLASS SUNSPOT ROTATED OVER THE LIMB AND WAS NUMBERED AS NEW
REGION 7798 (S12E77). TWO MODERATE SIZE FILAMENTS NEAR S15E00
FADED DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT MOSTLY LOW LEVELS DUE TO C-CLASS FLARE PRODUCTION FROM
REGION 7794. THERE IS A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF A SMALL M-CLASS
FLARE FROM THIS REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD BEGAN THE PERIOD QUIETLY. HOWEVER, A
SUDDEN IMPULSE OF 24 GAMMA WAS OBSERVED AT 29/0025Z. THIS IS
ATTRIBUTED TO A LONG DURATION EVENT THAT OCCURRED ON
25/1000Z FOR A LENGTHY 86 HOUR DELAY. THE FIELD BECAME ACTIVE
SHORTLY AFTER THE IMPULSE AND MINOR TO SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS
FOLLOWED IN THE 0900-1800Z PERIOD. SOME HIGH LATITUDE SITES
EXPERIENCED K INDICES OF 9 IN THE 1200-1500Z INTERVAL. A
BRIEF MAGNETOPAUSE CROSSING WAS OBSERVED AT GOES-7 (112W)
BETWEEN 29/1430-1433Z. AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, THE FIELD
HAD CALMED TO UNSETTLED LEVELS. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES
BEGAN THE PERIOD AT HIGH LEVELS BUT DROPPED TO NORMAL
BACKGROUND VALUES BY 29/0300Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS FOR 30 OCT. AS
THE CURRENT DISTURBANCE EBBS, IT WILL BE REPLACED BY A
CORONAL HOLE RELATED ONE. UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED THROUGH 03 NOV AS A RESULT
OF THAT HIGH SPEED STREAM. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES
SHOULD RETURN TO HIGH LEVELS AROUND 01 NOV.
