JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 227 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE OWING TO AN M1/2N
FLARE FROM REGION 7765 (S12W23) THAT MAXED AT 1251Z. IT WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY A 2695 MHZ RADIO BURST OF 250 FLUX UNITS OF
15 MINUTES DURATION (TENFLARE). REGION 7765 DECLINED TODAY
IN BOTH WHITE LIGHT AND MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY. NO NEW REGIONS WERE
NUMBERED. ACTIVE PROMINENCES WERE REPORTED ON THE WEST LIMB NEAR
S04 AND N09.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7765 IS STILL CAPABLE OF C-CLASS FLARES AND
ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY, BUT THE OVERALL PROBABILITY OF
ENERGETIC EVENTS IS DECREASING AS THE REGION DECAYS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS. ISOLATED PERIODS AT ACTIVE LEVELS WERE OBSERVED AT
HIGH GEOMAGNETIC LATITUDES. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT WERE HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TOMORROW AS THE DISTURBANCE OF THE
PAST FEW DAYS SUBSIDES. A POSSIBLE NEW DISTURBANCE COULD BEGIN
ON THE 17TH IN RESPONSE TO INTERPLANETARY EFFECTS WITH A LONG
DURATION X-RAY EVENT NEAR THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR DISK ON
14 AUGUST.
