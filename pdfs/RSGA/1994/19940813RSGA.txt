JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 225 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 AUG 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW DUE TO A C4/SF FLARE AT
1744Z FROM REGION 7765 (S11E03). THIS REGION CONTINUED TO EMERGE
AND EXHIBITED MIXED POLARITIES. A DELTA MAY BE FORMING NEAR THE
CENTER OF THE REGION. SEVERAL ARCH FILAMENT SYSTEMS WERE
REPORTED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  AT A MINIMUM, SOLAR ACTIVITY
SHOULD BE LOW. CONTINUED GROWTH IN REGION 7765 BODES WELL
FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL M-CLASS FLARES.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. MINOR
STORM CONDITIONS WERE EXPERIENCED AT MOST SITES BETWEEN
0300-0600Z. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES WERE AT A MODERATE
LEVEL FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD, BUT BECAME HIGH AT THE END OF
THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
INTERMITTENT ACTIVE PERIODS ARE PROBABLE AND ISOLATED MINOR
STORM INTERVALS ARE POSSIBLE.
