JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 011 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 11 JAN 1994
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 10/2100Z
TO 11/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7648 (N07W37)
PRODUCED SEVERAL SMALL C-CLASS FLARES. THIS REGION, AND ABUTTED
REGION 7650 (N05W27) WERE GENERALLY STABLE. THE TRAILER OF
7648 IS INTRUDING UPON THE LEADER OF REGION 7650 CREATING HIGH
MAGNETIC GRADIENTS THERE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE VERY
LOW TO LOW. AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE REMAINS A POSSIBILITY
FROM THE 7648/7650 COMPLEX.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 10/2100Z TO 11/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED UNTIL
APPROXIMATELY 1500Z WHEN THE FIELD BECAME DISTURBED. MID
LATITUDES WENT TO ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS. SOME HIGH
LATITUDE SITES EXPERIENCED MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS.
THE CORONAL HOLE IN THE SOUTHWEST IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF
THIS DISTURBANCE. THE TIME OF ONSET IS SLIGHTLY EARLIER
THAN EXPECTED.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS FOR 12 JAN. LOCAL
NIGHTTIME SECTORS COULD EXPERIENCE MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS.
NEAR ACTIVE LEVELS ARE FORECAST FOR 13-14 JAN WITH SOME
MINOR STORM PERIODS POSSIBLE DURING THAT TIME.
