IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. A 6 NANOTESLA SUDDEN IMPULSE OCCURRED
AT 01/1720Z. THIS TIMING CORRESPONDS CLOSELY WITH AN ANTICIPATED
SHOCK WAVE FROM A POSSIBLE CME EVIDENCED BY A TYPE II SWEEP ON
29/0646Z. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX WAS
HIGH FOR THE ENTIRE 24 HOUR PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS AS A SMALL
CORONAL HOLE MOVES INTO A FAVORABLE POSTION. HIGH LATITUDE
STATIONS SHOULD EXPECT PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING, ESPECIALLY
DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME. ACTIVITY SHOULD THEN DIMINISH TO QUIET
TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
