IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 23/2100Z
TO 24/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW AND BACKGROUND INDICES
DECREASED MARKEDLY AS THE REMNANTS OF REGION 7863 ROTATED

UNSETTLED. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES WERE IN THE LOW TO
MODERATE RANGE. SOLAR WIND DATA INDICATE A MODERATE VELOCITY
(400 KM/S) AND MODERATE DENSITY (10 P/CM3) STREAM IN THE
EARTH'S VICINITY, NOT A CORONAL HOLE STREAM AS WAS
PREVIOUSLY SUSPECTED.
