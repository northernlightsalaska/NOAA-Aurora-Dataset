JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 154 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 JUN 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED VERY LOW. EARLY IN THE
PERIOD, A SMALL REGION EMERGED NEAR NOOW11 AND WAS NUMBERED AS
NEW REGION 7874. SMALL SPOTS BECAME VISIBLE IN AN EXISTING
PLAGE NEAR S17E50 AND THIS AREA WAS NUMBERED AS REGION 7875.
SEVERAL SMALL FILAMENTS FADED FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE
DISK.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN AT
A VERY LOW LEVEL FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. A NEW REGION MAY
APPEAR AT THE NORTHEAST LIMB WHICH MAY INCREASE LEVELS
SLIGHTLY, BUT MORE DATA ARE NEEDED FOR A MEANINGFUL FORECAST.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. BRIEF
MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT SOME HIGH LATITUDE
SITES. RECENT SOLAR WIND DATA INDICATE THAT THE CORONAL HOLE
STREAM FROM THE FAR SOUTHWEST QUADRANT OF THE SUN IS STILL
IMPACTING THE EARTH. HOWEVER, THE VELOCITY WAS DECREASING
WHICH MAY IMPLY WE ARE NEAR THE END OF THAT HIGH SPEED
STREAM. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES WERE PREDOMINANTLY HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
ISOLATED ACTIVE PERIODS ARE POSSIBLE, ESPECIALLY ON 04 JUN,
AS THE CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE SUBSIDES.
