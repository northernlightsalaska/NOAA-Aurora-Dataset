IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 29/2100Z
TO 30/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW BY VIRTUE OF A SINGLE
C1/SF FLARE IN REGION 7858 (S15W21) AT 30/0010Z. THIS REGION
CONTINUES TO DECAY SLOWLY AND HAS BECOME MAGNETICALLY SIMPLE.
THERE WERE ALSO NUMEROUS UNCORRELATED B-CLASS X-RAY BURSTS
DETECTED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. NEW REGION 7862 (S07E14) WAS
NUMBERED TODAY.

VERY LOW TO LOW. REGION 7858 STILL HAS A CHANCE OF PRODUCING
OCCASSIONAL C-CLASS FLARES AND HAS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AN
ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS EXPERIENCED
A SHORT PERIOD OF MINOR STORMING ABOUT 30/15OOZ. THE GREATER
THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX WAS AT HIGH LEVELS OVER THE
PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.
ACTIVITY SHOULD INCREASE TO UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AFTER
THAT AS A WELL POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE MOVES INTO PLACE. HIGH
LATITUDE STATIONS SHOULD EXPECT PERIODS OF MINOR STORMING AT
THAT TIME.
