JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 034 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 03 FEB 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 02/2100Z
TO 03/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY RETURNED TO MODERATE LEVELS. REGION
7834 (S13E19) PRODUCED AN IMPULSIVE M4/2B FLARE AT 03/0151Z WITH
MODERATE RADIO BURSTS AND TWO DISTINCT TYPE II SWEEP EVENTS.
THIS REGION DECAYED SOMEWHAT BUT MIXED POLARITIES REMAINED AND
GREW SLIGHTLY. A SMALL FILAMENT NEAR REGION 7833 (S17W10)
ERUPTED AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LONG DURATION B2 X-RAY
ENHANCEMENT WHICH SPANNED THE PERIOD 03/0920-1107Z. THE SAN VITO
OBSERVATORY REPORTED A MORETON WAVE EMANATING FROM THE
ERUPTION SITE AND TRAVELLING TOWARD REGION 7834. YOHKOH IMAGERY
FOLLOWING THIS EVENT SHOWED A VERY LARGE AREA OF ENHANCED
EMISSION OVER MOST OF THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT INDICATING A
PROBABLE CORONAL MASS EJECTION AND SIGNIFICANT REARRANGEMENT OF
THE OVERLYING CORONAL FIELDS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
MOSTLY LOW. REGION 7834 RETAINS THE CAPABILITY OF PRODUCING
OCCASIONAL M-CLASS EVENTS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 02/2100Z TO 03/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. SOLAR WIND
DATA INDICATE THE EARTH IS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A LOW
DENSITY STREAM, PROBABLY OF CORONAL HOLE ORIGIN. THE ONLY
CANDIDATE HOLE IS THE SOUTHERN POLAR HOLE. ENERGETIC ELECTRON
FLUXES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ALTITUDE WERE IN THE MODERATE TO
HIGH RANGE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE UNTIL EARLY ON 06 FEB WHEN A
MAJOR STORM IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN RESPONSE TO THE
PROBABLE CORONAL MASS EJECTION MENTIONED ABOVE. PERIODS OF
SEVERE STORMING ARE POSSIBLE DURING THAT TIME.
PREDICTION OF THE ARRIVAL TIME OF THIS DISTURBANCE IS
DIFFICULT. THE ACTUAL BEGIN TIME COULD BE OFF BY AS MUCH AS
A DAY.
