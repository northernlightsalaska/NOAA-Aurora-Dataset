JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 169 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 18 JUN 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 17/2100Z
TO 18/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. NEW REGION 7882
(N06E70) PRODUCED A SHORT-LIVED B2/SF FLARE AT 18/1700Z. FOUR
OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED B-CLASS X-RAY BURSTS WERE DETECTED.
A 12 DEGREE DISAPPEARING FILAMENT WAS REPORTED IN THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT OF THE SOLAR DISK BUT IS NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A
DISTURBANCE. NEW REGION 7881 (N01E06) WAS ALSO NUMBERED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW. REGION 7882 HAS A CHANCE OF PRODUCING ISOLATED C-CLASS
FLARE ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 17/2100Z TO 18/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ALL LATITUDES EXPERIENCED ONE
PERIOD OF MINOR STORMING AT ABOUT 18/0900Z. THE CAUSE OF THIS
ACTIVITY IS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT. SOLAR WIND DATA RECEIVED
FROM THE WIND SPACECRAFT INDICATED A MODERATELY HIGH DENSITY
WIND WITH LOW VELOCITY AND A NORTHWARD BZ JUST AFTER THE TIME
OF THE DISTURBANCE INDICATING A TRANSIENT CAUSE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THE
FIELD IS THEN EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD BECAUSE OF A FAVORABLY
POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS MAY SEE PERIODS
OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING DURING THAT TIME.
