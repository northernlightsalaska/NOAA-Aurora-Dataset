JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 051 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 20 FEB 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7844 (N11E16),
NEWLY NUMBERED YESTERDAY, DEVELOPED RAPIDLY AND PRODUCED AN
M1/1N FLARE AT 20/0321Z WITH AN ASSOCIATED TYPE II SWEEP.
THE REGION THEN BEGAN TO DECAY SLOWLY AND HAS BEEN RELATIVELY
INACTIVE SINCE. REGION 7843 (S13E03) HAS BEEN A PROLIFIC FLARE
PRODUCER THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IT PRODUCED 5 C-CLASS FLARES,
THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS A C3.9/1N FLARE AT 20/0111Z, AND A
NUMBER OF SUBFAINT FLARES. THIS REGION CONTINUED TO DEVELOP AND
IS NOW MAGNETICALLY COMPLEX WITH A BETA-DELTA MAGNETIC
CONFIGURATION NEAR THE REGION CENTER. THE OTHER SPOTTED REGIONS
ON THE DISK WERE STABLE. NO NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7843 HAS A GOOD CHANCE FOR CONTINUED C-CLASS FLARE
ACTIVITY AND A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE. REGION 7844
IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ITS DECAY AND TO REMAIN GENERALLY
INACTIVE IN FLARE PRODUCTION. THERE IS STILL A SMALL CHANCE FOR
OCCASIONAL C-CLASS ACTIVITY IN THIS REGION AND AN OUTSIDE
CHANCE FOR ANOTHER SMALL M-CLASS FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 19/2100Z TO 20/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR
THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON FLUX
RANGED FROM MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST PERIOD.
HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS MAY EXPERIENCE UNSETTLED LEVELS MIDWAY
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO A POSSIBLE WEAK CORONAL MASS
EJECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE M1/1N FLARE IN REGION 7844.
