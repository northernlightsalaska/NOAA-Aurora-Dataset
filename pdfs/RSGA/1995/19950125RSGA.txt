JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 025 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 25 JAN 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 24/2100Z
TO 25/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  TWO OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED C1 X-RAYS EVENTS OCCURRED THIS PERIOD.  THE FIRST
WAS RECORDED AT 25/0006UT AND THE SECOND OCCURRED AT 25/0129UT.
REGION 7827 AT S07 LO114 ROTATED AROUND THE LIMB THIS PERIOD.
BASED ON ITS WHITE LIGHT GROWTH BEFORE ROTATING OFF, THIS
REGION MIGHT BEAR WATCHING IN TWO WEEKS WHEN IT'S DUE TO RETURN.
THE LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK, 7830 (N12W20), HAS BEEN VERY
QUIET.  THOUGH IT HAS DECAYED IN SPOT NUMBER AND OVERALL SIZE,
ITS BASIC CONFIGURATION HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED.  REGION 7829
(S14W20) REMAINS THE MOST ACTIVE REGION ON THE SUN.  7829 HAS
DECAYED MOSTLY INTO RUDIMENTARY PENUMBRA BUT INCLUDES NEW SPOTS
THAT COULD DISTINGUISH THIS REGION AS TWO SEPARATE GROUPS.
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IS NOT EXPECTED.  THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK
AND LIMB WAS QUIET AND UNCHANGED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS AS BOTH REGIONS 7829 AND 7830 HAVE
THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE C-CLASS X-RAY ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 24/2100Z TO 25/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
