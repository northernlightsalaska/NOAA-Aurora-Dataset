JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 074 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 MAR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY CONTINUED LOW. AN OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED C1 FLARE OCCURRED AT 0355Z. REGION 7854 (S15E67)
GREW SLIGHTLY (POSSIBLY DUE TO DECREASED FORESHORTENING) AND IS
NOW AN E CLASS GROUP OF ABOUT 200 MILLIONTHS IN AREA. SUNSPOT
FIELDS ARE BASICALLY BIPOLAR WITH SOME MINOR MIXED POLARITIES
VISIBLE IN THE PLAGE FIELDS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A LOW LEVEL DUE TO INTERMITTENT C-CLASS FLARES FROM REGION
7854. THERE IS A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SMALL M-CLASS FLARE
FROM THIS AREA.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED BETWEEN QUIET AND ACTIVE LEVELS.
THE CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE APPEARED TO BE WANING AT
THE END OF THE PERIOD. SOLAR WIND VELOCITIES DECLINED TO
BELOW 500 KM/S. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES REMAINED IN THE
HIGH TO VERY HIGH CATEGORIES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THERE
IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF ACTIVE CONDITIONS AT HIGH LATITUDES
EARLY ON 16 MAR.
