IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW.  NO SIGNIFICANT
ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED.  NEW REGION 7843 (S14E56) WAS NUMBERED
THIS PERIOD AS A BXO BETA GROUP.  THIS NEW REGION WAS THE
TRAILER PORTION OF REGION 7842 (S15E49).  AFTER OPTICAL AND
MAGNETIC ANALYSIS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT 7842 WAS ACTUALLY TWO

VERY LOW TO LOW FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  C-CLASS ACTIVITY
COULD EMANATE FROM THE INTERACTION BETWEEN REGIONS 7842 AND
7843.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 15/2100Z TO 16/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  ISOLATED INSTANCES OF HIGH
LATITUDE ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED.  THE GREATER THAN
2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ALTITUDE WAS
HIGH TO BORDERLINE VERY HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT ALL LATITUDES.
