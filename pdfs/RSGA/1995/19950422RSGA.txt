JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 112 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 22 APR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 21/2100Z
TO 22/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY BECAME HIGH. DEPARTING REGION 7863
(S04W94) PRODUCED A M7/2F FLARE AT 22/1151Z. MINOR CENTIMETRIC
BURSTS WERE OBSERVED WITH THIS EVENT AS WAS A MODERATE INTENSITY
TYPE IV. SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL MOTIONS ALONG THE WEST LIMB WERE
REPORTED BY OPTICAL OBSERVERS. ADDITIONALLY, AN M1 WAS OBSERVED
AT 22/1742Z WITH REGION 7863 AS THE PROBABLE BUT UNVERIFIED
SOURCE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE LOW TO
MODERATE. ALMOST NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF
REGION 7863 SO PERSISTENCE IS THE ONLY FORECAST TOOL AVAILABLE.
THIS INFERS THAT AN ISOLATED HIGH M-CLASS OR LOW X-CLASS FLARE
IS POSSIBLE. TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD, REGION 7863 SHOULD
BE FAR ENOUGH BEHIND THE WEST LIMB THAT ALL BUT MASSIVE FLARES
WOULD BE OCCULTED.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 21/2100Z TO 22/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE
PERIOD. THE LATTER HALF WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED WITH ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM CONDITIONS DETECTED AT SOME HIGH LATITUDE SITES.
A WEAK GT 10 MEV PROTON ENHANCEMENT BEGAN NEAR 22/1340Z.
FLUXES AFTER 1500Z WERE NEAR THE 1-2 PFU LEVEL. ENERGETIC
ELECTRON FLUXES BEGAN THE PERIOD AT MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS
AND BECAME LOW TO MODERATE DURING THE REMAINDER OF DAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVE FOR 23-24 APR. OCCASIONAL
MINOR TO ISOLATED MAJOR STORMING IS POSSIBLE DURING THAT
TIME. UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST
FOR 25 APR. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANOTHER LARGE FLARE FROM
REGION 7863, THE CURRENT PROTON ENHANCEMENT IS EXPECTED TO
SLOWLY DECAY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
