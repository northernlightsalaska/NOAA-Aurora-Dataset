JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 072 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 MAR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY REMAINED VERY LOW. AN OPTICALLY
UNCORRELATED LONG DURATION B6 OCCURRED BETWEEN 13/0639-0724Z.
A STRONG TYPE II WAS OBSERVED WITH THIS EVENT. A SMALL REGION
EMERGED NEAR N08W43 AND WAS NUMBERED AS NEW REGION 7853. THE
GOES X-RAY BACKGROUND INCREASED FROM ABOUT A4 TO B1 DURING THE
PERIOD. NO YOHKOH DATA WERE AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE IF A NEW
REGION IS AT THE EAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
AT A VERY LOW LEVEL.  HOWEVER, THE EAST LIMB SHOULD BE
WATCHED FOR THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW REGION OR RETURNING
REGION 7844 NEAR N11.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED BETWEEN UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS. SOME MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED
AT HIGH LATITUDE SITES. SOLAR WIND DATA INDICATE THERE IS
A HIGH SPEED, LOW DENSITY STREAM IN THE EARTH'S VICINITY
INDICATING THE SOURCE TO BE A CORONAL HOLE IN THE FAR
SOUTHWEST QUADRANT OF THE SUN. THE GT 2 MEV ELECTRON FLUXES
WERE HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE ON 14 MAR. ISOLATED MINOR
STORMING IS POSSIBLE EARLY ON 14 MAR. UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST FOR 15 MAR AS THE CURRENT CORONAL
HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE SUBSIDES. QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS ARE EXPECTED ON 16 MAR.
