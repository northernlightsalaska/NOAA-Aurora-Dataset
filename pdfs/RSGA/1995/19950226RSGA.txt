JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 057 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 26 FEB 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. A NEW REGION EMERGED
AT S16E60 AND WAS ASSIGNED AS 7846. THIS GROUP GREW FAIRLY
QUICKLY TO A C-TYPE GROUP AND SHOWS THE BRIGHTEST H-ALPHA
PLAGE ON THE DISK. REGION 7845 (S13E19) IS THE LARGEST REGION
ON DISK AS A 60 MILLIONTHS D-TYPE BUT IS STABLE. AN 11 DEGREE
FILAMENT DISAPPEARED FROM THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT BETWEEN
0006Z AND 1435Z TODAY.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
PREDOMINANTLY VERY LOW. REGION 7846 POSES A MODEST THREAT FOR
AN ISOLATED C-CLASS EVENT DURING THIS EARLY GROWTH PHASE OF ITS
EVOLUTION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 25/2100Z TO 26/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS. AN
INITIALLY VERY QUIET FIELD BECAME SLIGHTLY DISTURBED TO
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS BETWEEN 0500-1800Z WITH AN
ISOLATED MINOR STORM PERIOD AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM 0900-
1200Z. CONDITIONS SEEMED TO BE TAPERING OFF TO QUIET TO
UNSETTLED NEAR DAY'S END.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. THE COMBINED FACTORS OF PERSISTENCE, RECURRENCE AND POS-
SIBLE EFFECTS FROM TODAY'S FILAMENT ERUPTION (DUE BY THE 2ND
DAY), RAISE THE PROBABILITIES FOR OCCASIONAL DISTURBED PERIODS
DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.
