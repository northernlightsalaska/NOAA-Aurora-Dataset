IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO SEVERE STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. AN INITIALLY QUIET FIELD
BECAME GRADUALLY DISTURBED BEGINNING AROUND 0200Z. THE
DISTURBANCE BECAME A MINOR STORM AT MID-LATITUDES AND
A MAJOR STORM AT HIGH LATITUDES. THERE WERE SOME BRIEF
PERIODS OF MAJOR STORM AT MID-LATITUDES AND SEVERE STORM
AT HIGH LATITUDES DURING THE MOST INTENSE PART OF THE
DISTURBANCE. THESE DISTURBED PERIODS WERE FROM 0600-0800Z,
0900-1000Z, AND 1500-1700Z. THE DISTURBANCE WAS MOST LIKELY
CAUSED BY A CORONAL HOLE: NEAR REAL-TIME WIND OBSERVATIONS
(FROM 1618-1959Z) INDICATED A SOLAR WIND SIGNATURE OF
RELATIVELY HIGH VELOCITY, LOW DENSITY, AND GENERALLY
SOUTHWARD INTERPLANETARY FIELD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE AT ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
