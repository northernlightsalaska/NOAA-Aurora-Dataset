JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 137 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 MAY 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7870 (N10W51) GREW
SLIGHTLY TODAY AND PRODUCED A FEW SUBFLARES. THE GROWTH RATE AND
FLARE FREQUENCY WERE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.
THE REGION SHOWS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE BETA MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION
WITH STRONG TRAILER SPOTS. REGION 7871 (S13W20) GREW SIGNIFI-
CANTLY TODAY AND IS NOW THE LARGEST GROUP ON THE DISK AT 300
MILLIONTHS. NEVERTHELESS, FLARE ACTIVITY FROM THIS REGION WAS
REDUCED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS. THE GROUP HAS STRONG MAGNETIC
FIELDS IN A TYPICAL BIPOLAR MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-
CLASS EVENT FROM EITHER OF 7870 OR 7871.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM UNSETTLED TO STORM LEVELS.
CONDITIONS WERE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FROM
16/2100Z TO 17/0400Z. ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DOMINATED
BETWEEN 0400-1100Z, WITH SOME MAJOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS
AT THE HIGH LATITUDE SITES. CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY UN-
SETTLED SINCE 1100Z. A BRIEF LOOK AT SOLAR WIND CONDITIONS
TODAY SHOWED A MODERATELY FAST, LOW DENSITY WIND WITH SOUTH-
WARD BZ, SUGGESTING THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THE LAST 24 HOURS
WAS PROBABLY FROM A CORONAL HOLE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS DUE TO CONTINUED
CORONAL HOLE EFFECTS. CONDITIONS SHOULD SUBSIDE TO MOSTLY
UNSETTLED FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS.
