JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 073 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 14 MAR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 13/2100Z
TO 14/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. NEW REGION 7854 (S15E76)
IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF A LONG DURATION C1 FLARE AT 14/0546Z. A
MODERATE INTENSITY TYPE II BURST ACCOMPANIED THIS EVENT. REGION
7854 APPEARS TO BE SMALL TO MODERATE SIZE CLASS D GROUP. THIS
REGION EMERGED DURING ITS INVISIBLE HEMISPHERE TRANSIT. SEVERAL
OTHER SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED IN THIS REGION DURING THE PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
MOSTLY LOW WITH C-CLASS FLARES POSSIBLE FROM NEW REGION
7854. AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE MUST BE CONSIDERED POSSIBLE.
ONCE MORE IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS REGION, A MORE CONFIDENT
ASSESSMENT CAN BE MADE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 13/2100Z TO 14/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT ALMOST ALL
LATITUDES. REAL TIME SOLAR WIND DATA INDICATE A DECREASE IN
VELOCITY OF ABOUT 100 KM/S OVER VALUES OBSERVED ON 13 MAR.
ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES WERE IN THE HIGH TO VERY HIGH
CATEGORIES DURING THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE ON 15 MAR AS THE
CURRENT DISTURBANCE SUBSIDES. QUIET TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS
