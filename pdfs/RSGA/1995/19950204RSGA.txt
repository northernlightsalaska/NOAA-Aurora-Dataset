JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 035 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 FEB 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 7834 (S13E05)
PRODUCED AN M2/2B AT 04/1544Z WITH A TYPE II AND MODERATE CM
BURSTS. THE X-RAY RISE WAS IMPULSIVE AND SO WAS THE EARLY DECAY.
HOWEVER, THE LATE DECAY PHASE LASTED OVER 4 HOURS. THIS REGION
SHOWED SLIGHT OVERALL DECAY BUT AN OPPOSITE POLARITY ISOLATED
POLE SOUTH OF THE LEADER SPOT REMAINED. MAGNETIC GRADIENTS WERE
MODERATE THERE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD DECLINE
TO GENERALLY LOW LEVELS AS THE SUNSPOT AREA IN REGION 7834
CONTINUES TO DECREASE. AN OCCASIONAL SMALL M-CLASS FLARE
FROM THIS REGION REMAINS A POSSIBILITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, THE FIELD WAS UNSETTLED.
MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED IN THE 03/0000-0300Z
PERIOD. ACTIVE LEVELS WERE DETECTED BETWEEN 0300-0900Z.
THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. THE
GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON FLUXES WERE AT MODERATE TO HIGH
LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD REMAIN UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR 05 FEB. A MAJOR
STORM IS FORECAST TO BEGIN ON 06 FEB IN RESPONSE TO A
PROBABLE CORONAL MASS EJECTION ON 03 FEB. PERIODS OF
SEVERE STORMING ARE POSSIBLE. MINOR TO MAJOR STORM
