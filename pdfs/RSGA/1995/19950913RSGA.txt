JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 256 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 SEP 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. NO FLARES WERE
OBSERVED. REGION 7905 (N11W84) IS THE ONLY SPOTTED REGION ON
THE SUN AND WILL SOON ROTATE OUT OF VIEW.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. AN INITIALLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED FIELD
BECAME MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE WITH SOME MINOR STORMING
AT HIGH LATITUDES BETWEEN 0400-1200Z. CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN
PREDOMINANTLY QUIET SINCE 1200Z. WIND OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST
THAT THE ACTIVITY WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY A HIGH SPEED,
LOW DENSITY WIND STREAM. SUCH STREAMS TYPICALLY ORIGINATE
FROM CORONAL HOLES. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON FLUX
WAS HIGH THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT TWO
DAYS. CONDITIONS SHOULD BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED BY THE THIRD DAY.
