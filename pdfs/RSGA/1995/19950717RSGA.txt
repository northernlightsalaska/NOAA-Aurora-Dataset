SDF NUMBER 198 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 17 JUL 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 16/2100Z
TO 17/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. REGION 7890 (N04W23)

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 16/2100Z TO 17/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS PREDOMINATED FROM 16/2100Z
THROUGH 17/0700Z. A BRIEF LULL FROM 0700-1200Z WAS FOLLOWED
BY ANOTHER INCREASE TO ACTIVE LEVELS FROM 1200-1600Z. SINCE
1600Z THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD, QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
HAVE PREVAILED. DATA FROM THE WIND SPACECRAFT (1420-1708Z) IN-
DICATED A HIGH-SPEED, LOW DENSITY SOLAR WIND. THIS SUGGESTS
THAT A FAVORABLY POSITIONED CORONAL HOLE IS THE MOST LIKELY
CAUSE OF THE LATTER PART OF TODAY'S ACTIVITY, THE GREATER THAN
2 MEV ELECTRON FLUXES AT GOES-8 (W078) EXCEEDED 1000 PFU AT
1310Z AND HAVE REMAINED ABOVE THIS LEVEL THROUGH THE END OF THE
