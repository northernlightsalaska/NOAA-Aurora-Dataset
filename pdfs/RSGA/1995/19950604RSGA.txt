JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 155 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 04 JUN 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. REGION 7874 (N01W27)
GREW RAPIDLY DURING THE PERIOD AND PRODUCED FREQUENT INTENSITY
FLUCTUATIONS AND SEVERAL B-CLASS SUBFLARES. THIS REGION IS
MAGNETICALLY BIPOLAR. A LARGE PROMINENCE CENTERED NEAR S17E90
ERUPTED TO 0.17R ABOVE THE LIMB BETWEEN 04/0343-0450Z. THE
SOUTHEAST LIMB SHOWED ENHANCED X-RAY EMISSION WHERE OLD REGION
7871 IS DUE TO RETURN.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS FORECAST TO BE
VERY LOW. CONTINUED GROWTH IN REGION 7874 COULD RESULT IN
SMALL C-CLASS FLARES FROM THAT AREA. THE REGION APPROACHING
THE SOUTHEAST LIMB MAY ALSO RAISE ACTIVITY LEVELS SLIGHTLY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. SOLAR WIND DATA
CONTINUED TO SHOW A DECREASE IN WIND VELOCITY (500 KM/S) AS
THE CORONAL HOLE RELATED DISTURBANCE WANED. ENERGETIC
ELECTRON FLUXES WERE MODERATE TO HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
