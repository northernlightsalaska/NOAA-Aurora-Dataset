JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 086 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 27 MAR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 26/2100Z
TO 27/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW.  REGION 7858 (S16E21)
REMAINED THE MOST ACTIVE REGION ON THE DISK PRODUCING A B9/SF
AT 27/1857UT.  ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FLARE WAS REPORTED WEAK
RADIO EMISSION COVERING 25 MHZ TO 15.4 GHZ.  IN THE PAST 24
HOURS, THIS REGION HAS GROWN QUITE DRAMATICALLY NEARLY DOUBLING
ITS AREA AS VIEWED IN WHITE LIGHT.  IT ALSO HAS INDICATED MORE
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY EVOLVING FROM A SIMPLE BETA TO A BETA
GAMMA DELTA GROUP.  NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY REPORTED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  REGION 7858'S MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY LENDS ITSELF TO C-CLASS
ACTIVITY WITH A WEAK CHANCE OF M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 26/2100Z TO 27/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
LEVELS IN THE MIDDLE LATITUDES FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  AT
HIGHER LATITUDES, THE FIELD WAS MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
WITH PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS OBSERVED.  THE
GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX WAS AT NORMAL
BACKGROUND LEVELS BUT DID INDICATE A RAPID RISE TOWARD
MODERATE LEVELS THE LAST 6 HOURS OF THE PERIOD.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT ALL LEVELS FOR
THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  HIGH LATITUDES
CAN EXPECT ISOLATED PERIODS OF MINOR STORM CONDITIONS DURING
THAT TIME FRAME.  THE FIELD IS EXPECTED TO RELAX TO MOSTLY
QUIET TO UNSETTLED BY DAY THREE.  A WELL POSITIONED SOUTHERN
CORNOAL HOLE IS THOUGHT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVITY.
