JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 258 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 15 SEP 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 14/2100Z
TO 15/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW. NEW REGION 7906
(S19W75) EMERGED ON DISK BUT WAS STABLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY LOW.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 14/2100Z TO 15/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WITH
SOME BRIEF HIGH LATITUDE MAJOR STORM PERIODS. AN INITIALLY
QUIET FIELD BECAME DISTURBED FROM ABOUT 0200-1500Z. MID-
LATITUDES WERE AT MOSTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS, AND HIGH
LATITUDES WERE PREDOMINANTLY AT ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.
A BRIEF INTERVAL OF WIND DATA INDICATED A MODERATE DENSITY
(10-20P/CC), MODERATE SPEED (440-450KM/S) WIND WITH FAIRLY
STRONG NEGATIVE BZ (-7 TO -5 NT). THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT A
TRANSIENT IN THE SOLAR WIND WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY.
CONDITIONS DECLINED TO QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS FROM 1500Z
TO THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON
FLUXES RANGED FROM NORMAL BACKGROUND TO HIGH LEVELS DURING
THE PAST 24 HOURS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE UNSETTLED TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE OVER THE NEXT 12 TO
24 HOURS DUE TO PERSISTENCE. QUIET TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS ARE
EXPECTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
