JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 031 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 31 JAN 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 30/2100Z
TO 31/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7832 (S21W72) WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ONLY TWO OPTICALLY CORRELATED C-CLASS FLARES
OF THE PERIOD, A C1/SF FLARE AT 30/2117Z AND A C2/SF FLARE AT
31/1554Z. SIX UNCORRELATED C-CLASS X-RAY BURSTS WERE RECORDED,
THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS A C9 BURST AT 311005Z. X-RAY IMAGING
TAKEN AT THE TIME OF THE FLARE ASSOCIATES THIS BURST WITH REGION
7832. THIS REGION CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE PERIOD. REGION
7834 (S12E60) CONTINUED TO GROW AS WELL. IT PRODUCED FOUR
B-CLASS FLARES DURING THE PERIOD, ONE OF WHICH WAS A B6/1F FLARE

LOW. REGION 7832 HAS A GOOD CHANCE OF CONTINUED C-CLASS ACTIVITY
AND AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE. REGION 7834
HAS A FAIR CHANCE OF PRODUCING C-CLASS ACTIVITY AND ALSO HAS AN
OUTSIDE CHANCE OF PRODUCING AN ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE.

THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRON
FLUX RANGED FROM MODERATE TO HIGH.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
