JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 088 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 29 MAR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 28/2100Z
TO 29/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. REGION 7858 (S15W06)
PRODUCED THREE C-CLASS FLARES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS A
C1/1F FLARE AT 29/1852Z. A C1/SF FLARE AT 29/0649Z, ALSO FROM
THIS REGION, HAD AN ASSOCIATED TYPE II RADIO SWEEP. A SECOND
TYPE II SWEEP, UNCORRELATED, WAS REPORTED SHORTLY AFTERWARD.
NUMEROUS UNCORRELATED B-CLASS X-RAY BURSTS WERE ALSO DETECTED.
REGION 7858 IS MAINTAINING ITS MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY, BUT HAS
DECAYED SLOWLY OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE
NUMBERED TODAY, REGION 7860 (S02E08) AND REGION 7861 (S04W08).
BOTH ARE SMALL BXO SPOT GROUPS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 7858 HAS AN EXCELLENT CHANCE FOR FURTHER C-CLASS
FLARE PRODUCTION AND A SMALL CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED M-CLASS
FLARE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 28/2100Z TO 29/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. HIGH LATITUDE STATIONS EXPERIENCED
MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC
ELECTRON FLUX RANGED FROM NORMAL TO HIGH LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, THEN
QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
