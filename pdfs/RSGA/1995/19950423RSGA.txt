JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 113 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 23 APR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 22/2100Z
TO 23/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. A C9 FLARE OCCURRED AT
23/0216Z AND A LONG DURATION C1 REACHED MAXIMUM AT 23/1706Z.
DEPARTED REGION 7863 (S04W106) IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THE FIRST
EVENT AS THERE WERE NO SPOTS ON THE VISIBLE DISK DURING THE
PERIOD AND YOHKOH IMAGERY SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT REGION BEYOND THE
EAST LIMB. THE LONG DURATION C1 WAS IN TIME COINCIDENCE WITH A
VERY ACTIVE PROMINENCE AT NW17. REPORTS OF MATERIAL FALLING BACK
TO THE SURFACE WERE RECEIVED.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
LOW FOR AT LEAST ONE MORE DAY WITH FLARES OCCURRING
BEYOND THE WEST LIMB. THERE IS AN ISOLATED POSSIBILITY
OF ANOTHER M-CLASS FLARE FROM THAT LOCATION BEFORE IT
ROTATES COMPLETELY FROM VIEW. VERY LOW LEVELS ARE
FORECAST FOR 25-26 APR.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 22/2100Z TO 23/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
SOME HIGH LATITUDE SITES EXPERIENCED ISOLATED MINOR TO MAJOR
STORM PERIODS. THE MINOR PROTON ENHANCEMENT THAT BEGAN ON
22 APR SLOWLY DECLINED TO NEAR BACKGROUND LEVELS DURING THE
PERIOD. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES WERE LOW EARLY IN THE
PERIOD BUT INCREASED TO MODERATE LEVELS AT THE END.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
IS FORECAST TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE FOR
24-25 APR. MINOR TO MAJOR STORM PERIODS AT HIGH LATITUDES
ARE PROBABLE DURING THAT TIME. QUIET TO UNSETTLED CONDITIONS
ARE FORECAST FOR 26 APR. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES SHOULD
INCREASE TO HIGH LEVELS OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
