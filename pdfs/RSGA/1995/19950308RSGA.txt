TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW.  REGION 7846 (S15W72)
PRODUCED TWO C1/SF X-RAY FLARES WITH WEAK LOWER DISCRETE
FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSION.  THE FIRST FLARE OCCURRED AT 08/0454UT
AND WAS LONG DURATION IN NATURE. THE SECOND WAS RECORDED AT
08/1720UT.  NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED FROM
THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK AND LIMB.

IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET LEVELS FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS.  THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUX AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ALTITUDE WAS AT NORMAL TO MODERATE LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORM ACTIVITY CAN BE EXPECTED AT
ALL LATITUDES DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME HOURS.  THIS FORECAST IS
BASED ON A RECURRENT CORONAL HOLE FEATURE THAT IS ROTATING
INTO A FAVORABLE POSITION AND THE LONG DURATION X-RAY EVENT
OBSERVED AT 08/0454UT.
