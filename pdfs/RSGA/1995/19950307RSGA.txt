JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 066 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 07 MAR 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 06/2100Z
TO 07/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS VERY LOW.  THE LARGEST EVENT OF
THE PERIOD WAS AN OPTICALLY UNCORRELATED B7 X-RAY EVENT WITH
WEAK LOWER DISCRETE FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSION.  REGION 7846
(S16W58) REMAINS THE LARGEST REGION ON THE DISK AT 160 MILS.
OVERALL, THE REGION HAS EXHIBITED SOME DECAY IN THE TRAILER
PORTION OF THE GROUP.  REGION 7849 (S07W65) HAS SHOWN THE MOST
CHANGE INDICATING A TWO TO THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN AREA AND SPOT
COUNT BUT STILL REMAINING A BXO BETA GROUP.  NO OTHER
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES NOTED ON THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK OR LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  REGION 7846
STILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE C-CLASS X-RAY ACTIVITY
BEFORE IT ROTATES AROUND THE DISK.  ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO
DECREASE TO VERY LOW BY DAY THREE.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 06/2100Z TO 07/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED LEVELS
THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ENERGETIC ELECTRON
FLUX WAS AT MODERATE LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET TO ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
PERIODS OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORM ACTIVITY CAN BE EXPECTED AT
ALL LATITUDES DURING LOCAL NIGHTTIME HOURS.  A RECURRENT
CORONAL HOLE FEATURE IS ROTATING INTO FAVORABLE POSITION AND
IS EXPECTED TO BE THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE ACTIVITY
INCREASE.
