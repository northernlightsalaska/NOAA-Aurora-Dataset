THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS MOSTLY ACTIVE AT MID-LATITUDES AND
WAS AT ACTIVE TO STORM LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS. THE PEAK OF THE DISTURBANCE WAS BETWEEN 0600-1200Z
WHEN MINOR TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS WERE REPORTED AT MANY SITES.
THE MOSTLY LIKELY SOURCE FOR THE DISTURBANCE WAS THE FILA-
MENT ERUPTION OF 26 FEBRUARY.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED WITH OCCASIONAL ACTIVE
PERIODS OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. SOME RESIDUAL EFFECTS ARE
