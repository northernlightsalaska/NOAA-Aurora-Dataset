DECAY, PARTICULARILY IN THE TRAILER PORTION OF THE GROUP.  NO
SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY HAS BEEN OBSERVED FROM 7830 IN THE PAST
24 HOURS.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS AS BOTH REGIONS 7829 AND 7830 HAVE
THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE C-CLASS X-RAY ACTIVITY.

IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY QUIET FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  LEVELS
