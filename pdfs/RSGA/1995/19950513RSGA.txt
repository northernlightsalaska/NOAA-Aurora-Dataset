JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
SDF NUMBER 133 ISSUED AT 2200Z ON 13 MAY 1995
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY BECAME LOW. SEVERAL C-CLASS FLARES
WERE PRODUCED BY REGION 7870 (N10E04). THE LARGEST WAS A C2/1F
AT 13/0726Z WITH MINOR CENTIMETRIC BURSTS. THIS REGION GREW
RAPIDLY DURING THE PERIOD BUT WAS BASICALLY BIPOLAR WITH SOME
MINOR MAGNETIC COMPLEXITIES. REGION 7869 (S03W13) DECAYED.
A SMALL NEW REGION EMERGED NEAR S16E36 AND WAS NUMBERED AS
REGION 7871. A SMALL REGION ROTATED OVER THE EAST LIMB NEAR N10
AND WAS NUMBERED AS 7872. THIS AREA IS COMPACT AND MODERATELY
BRIGHT IN YOHKOH IMAGES.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANTLY LOW AS REGION 7870 CONTINUES TO GROW AND
PRODUCE C-CLASS FLARES. IF RAPID GROWTH CONTINUES, THERE IS
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ISOLATED LOW LEVEL M-CLASS BURST FROM
THIS REGION.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 12/2100Z TO 13/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED. ENERGETIC
ELECTRON FLUXES RANGED BETWEEN LOW AND HIGH LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD
SHOULD BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
