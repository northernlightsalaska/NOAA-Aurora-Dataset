JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 20 DEC 1988
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 19/2100Z
TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH.  AN M7 X-RAY FLARE
OCCURRED AT 20/1244Z AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG TYPE II/IV
RADIO SWEEP AND A 2695 MHZ RADIO BURST OF 690 SFU.  OPTICAL
CORRELATION WAS NOT DEFINITE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT
THE SOUTHEAST LIMB MAY BE THE SOURCE.  REGION 5278 (N27W24)
IS STILL THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLEX REGION ON THE DISK BUT
HAS NOT PRODUCED MAJOR FLARE ACTIVITY DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS.

MODERATE TO HIGH.  REGIONS 5278, 5280 (N26W10), 5285 (N21E51),
AND THE NEW REGION BEYOND THE SOUTHEAST LIMB (IF IT EXISTS)
MAY PRODUCE ENERGETIC ACTIVITY.
