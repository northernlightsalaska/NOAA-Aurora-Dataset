IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 25/2100Z
TO 26/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS HIGH. REGION 5292 (S17E20)
PRODUCED AN M6/1B AT 26/2043Z. VERY LITTLE RADIO EMISSION WAS
OBSERVED WITH THE FLARE. REGION 5292 EVOLVED RAPIDLY DURING
THE PERIOD WITH DRAMATIC INCREASES IN AREA AND MAGNETIC
COMPLEXITY. THIS REGION ALSO PRODUCED AN M1/1N AT 26/2022Z.
REGION 5290 (N22E10) GREW SLIGHTLY DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS.
THE WEST LIMB OUTER CORONA CONTINUED TO BE DISTURBED - THE
LATEST MASS EJECTION REPORTED BY THE SMM CORONAGRAPH WAS
24/1230-1500Z FROM THE SOUTHWEST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
GENERALLY MODERATE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. AS WITH THE M6
FLARE TODAY, ISOLATED MID LEVEL CLASS M FLARES ARE POSSIBLE.
SHOULD THE CURRENT GROWTH TREND CONTINUE IN REGION 5292,
MID LEVEL M AND HIGHER FLARES SHOULD BECOME MORE FREQUENT.
