IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION
5131 (S23W85) PRODUCED TWO M-CLASS X-RAY FLARES DURING THE
PAST 24 HOURS, AN M2/1N AT 08/1241Z AND AN M1/SN AT 08/1847Z.
THE SECOND M-CLASS FLARE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A TYPE II RADIO

LOW TO MODERATE.  ANOTHER ISOLATED M-CLASS FLARE IS POSSIBLE
FROM REGION 5131 AS IT ROTATES AROUND THE WEST LIMB.  CORONAL
