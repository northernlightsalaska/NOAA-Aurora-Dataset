TO 20/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LOW.  REGION 5075
(S21W35) REMAINS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE REGION ON THE DISK BUT
COULD ONLY PRODUCE A FEW LOW LEVEL C-CLASS X-RAY FLARES DURING
THE PAST 24 HOURS.  OVERALL SUNSPOT AREA HAS CHANGED LITTLE
BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION IN THE CENTRAL
PORTION OF THE REGION.  A LONG DURATION C1.5 X-RAY FLARE
OCCURRED AT 20/0715UT.  THIS FLARE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
STRONG TYPE II RADIO SWEEP AND A CORONAL MASS EJECTION FROM
BEYOND THE SOUTHEAST LIMB.  TWO SMALL REGIONS EMERGED SINCE
YESTERDAY - 5081 (S21W23) AND 5082 (N26E15).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  A SLIGHT CHANCE OF ENERGETIC ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE
FROM REGION 5075.  OLD REGION 5060 (S20,L-0002) IS DUE AT THE
EAST LIMB ON 22 JULY AND MAY BE THE SOURCE OF THE LDE X-RAY
