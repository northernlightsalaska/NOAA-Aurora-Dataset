IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 07/2100Z
TO 08/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS LOW. ONLY A FEW MINOR CLASS C
EVENTS WERE OBSERVED.  REGION 5171 (S26W86) IS MAKING A QUIET
LIMB TRANSIT. REGION 5177 (N22E14) AND 5178 WERE COMBINED INTO

MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. REGION 5179 (S27W15) GREW AT A MODERATE PACE
AND IS NOW A CLASS D SUNSPOT GROUP. A SMALL CLASS H SPOT ROTATED
AROUND THE LIMB AND WAS NUMBERED AS REGION 5184 (S12E73).
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE
PREDOMINANTLY LOW FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. ISOLATED CLASS M
FLARES ARE POSSIBLE FROM REGIONS 5171, 5175, AND 5177.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 07/2100Z TO 08/2100Z:

SHOULD CONTINUE AT RECENT LEVELS FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS WITH
GENERALLY UNSETTLED CONDITIONS AT MID LATITUDES AND
UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS AT HIGH LATITUDES.
