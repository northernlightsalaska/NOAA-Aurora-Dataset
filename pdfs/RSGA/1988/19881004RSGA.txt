IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN HIGH.  ACTIVITY REMAINED
AT HIGH LEVELS DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF A X1/2B FLARE AT
03/2336Z FROM REGION 5171 (S25W31).  THIS REGION SEEMS TO HAVE
SIMPLIFIED SOMEWHAT, ALTHOUGH A WEAK DELTA CONFIGURATION APPEARS
TO REMAIN.  NEW REGION 5179 (S28E40) EMERGED AS A SMALL BIPOLE.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE.  REGIONS 5168 (N21W72), 5171, AND 5177 (N24E61) ARE
THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY.  ANOTHER
MAJOR FLARE, ALTHOUGH LESS LIKELY THAN DURING THE PREVIOUS
