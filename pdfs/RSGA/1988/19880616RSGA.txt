IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 15/2100Z
TO 16/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LOW.  FLARES OCCURRED IN A
NUMBER OF REGIONS DURING THE INTERVAL WITH THE LARGEST EVENT A
C8/0B FROM REGION 5047 (S16E47) AT 15/2245Z.  THAT REGION AND
REGION 5041 (N13W41) HAVE GROWN IN WHITE LIGHT AND H-ALPHA
DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS.  TWO NEW REGIONS WERE NUMBERED,
REGIONS 5051 (N34E39) AND 5052 (N30E41).  BOTH ARE SIMPLE IN
STRUCTURE BUT ARE INTERESTING DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO OLD
MATURE REGION 5048 (N37E51).  THE X-RAY AND 10 CM. BACKGROUND
VALUES INCREASED DURING THE DAY.  SURGING WAS NOTED AT EAST
LIMB NEAR S26.  SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING HAS OCCURRED IN A
LARGE FILAMENT POSITIONED NEAR S60W20.

LOW TO MODERATE.  ISOLATED M-CLASS ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE FROM
