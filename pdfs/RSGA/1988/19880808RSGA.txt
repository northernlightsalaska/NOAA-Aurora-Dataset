(N22E17) DOUBLED IN SIZE DURING THE PERIOD AND BEGAN TO PRODUCE
CLASS C FLARES. A LARGE FILAMENT, WHICH AT THIS TIME WOULD HAVE
BEEN LOCATED BETWEEN S38W39-S25W65, ERUPTED NEAR 08/1018Z. A
SLOW CORONAL MASS EJECTION WAS OBSERVED BY THE SOLAR MAXIMUM
MISSION AT THAT TIME IN THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT OF THE FIELD OF
VIEW OF THE CORONAGRAPH. REGIONS 5107 (N32E53) AND 5108 (S20E68)

THE MID LATITUDE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET FOR THE PAST
24 HOURS. AT HIGH LATITUDES, THE FIELD WAS PREDOMINANTLY
UNSETTLED WITH BRIEF PERIODS AT ACTIVE LEVELS.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE MID LATITUDE FIELD
SHOULD REMAIN QUIET TO SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED. HIGH LATITUDE
CONDITIONS SHOULD BE PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED. THE LARGE
FILAMENT WHICH ERUPTED TODAY IS NOT EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE
EARTH.
