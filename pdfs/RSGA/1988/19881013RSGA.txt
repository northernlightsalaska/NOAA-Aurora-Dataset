JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 13 OCT 1988
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 12/2100Z
TO 13/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5175 (S16W85)
PRODUCED AN M6/0N FLARE WITH A SIGNIFICANT TYPE IV RADIO SWEEP
AND ALSO BOTH 245MHZ AND 2695MHZ BURSTS. IT WAS LAST OBSERVED
AS A BETA-GAMMA TYPE. NEWLY ASSIGNED REGION 5193 (N25E30) WAS
IN THE CROWDED EASTNORTHEAST SECTOR. A MODERATE CME WAS SEEN
AT 12/2224Z FROM THE SOUTHEAST LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW. REGION 5175 SHOULD BE TOO FAR AROUND TO AGAIN PROVIDE MORE
THAN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF MODERATE ACTIVITY, OR MORE THAN A VERY
SLIGHT CHANCE OF A PROTON PRODUCING FLARE. THE EASTNORTHEAST
GROUP OF REGIONS PROVIDE A FAIR CHANCE OF MODERATE ACTIVITY,
AND A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE OF A PROTON PRODUCING FLARE.
