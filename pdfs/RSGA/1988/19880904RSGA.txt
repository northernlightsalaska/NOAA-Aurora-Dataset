SDF NUMBER 248
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 04 SEP 1988
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 03/2100Z
TO 04/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LOW. ONLY SMALL C-CLASS
SUBFLARES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD, AND MOST OF THESE
WERE PRODUCED BY REGION 5131 (S20W31) WHICH CONTINUES TO BE
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE REGION ON THE DISK. FOUR NEW REGIONS
WERE ASSIGNED TODAY: REGION 5136 (N16W27), AN EMERGING SIMPLE
BI-POLAR GROUP, REGION 5137 (S20E75) WHICH ROTATED INTO VIEW
AS A BI-POLAR C-TYPE GROUP, REGION 5138 (N13E56) A SMALL
A-TYPE SPOT, AND REGION 5139 (N35E70) A SIMPLE B-TYPE BI-POLAR
GROUP. AN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCE WAS OBSERVED AT ABOUT S20 ON THE
EAST LIMB AND EXTENDED OUT TO .06 SOLAR RADII. THE REMAINDER
OF THE SOLAR DISK AND LIMBS WERE STABLE OR DECLINING.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
GENERALLY LOW. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
MODERATE LEVELS FROM REGION 5131.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 03/2100Z TO 04/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES
AND WAS UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND MOSTLY
ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES.
