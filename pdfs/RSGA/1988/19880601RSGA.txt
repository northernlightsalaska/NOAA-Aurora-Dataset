SDF NUMBER 153
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 01 JUN 1988
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 31/2100Z
TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LOW.  REGION 5027
(S24W61) CONTINUED TO DECAY SLOWLY.  ACTIVITY IN THIS REGION
HAS DECREASED OVER THE PAST DAY.  REGION 5032 (N17E39)
CONTINUES TO GROW.  ADDITIONAL SUNSPOTS AND INCREASED
MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY HAVE DEVELOPED DURING THE PAST DAY.  THIS
REGION WAS KEPT AS A SINGLE NUMBERED REGION TODAY BECAUSE OF
THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH; HOWEVER, IT IS NOW BELIEVED TO BE A
COMPOUND REGION COMPOSED OF TWO SEPARATE SUNSPOT GROUPS WHICH
HAVE GROWN TOGETHER.  REGION 5032 HAS PRODUCED A FEW C-CLASS
X-RAY BURSTS AND OPTICAL SUBFLARES.  NEW REGION 5034 (S21E69)
ROTATED AROUND THE LIMB AS A SMALL D-TYPE SUNSPOT GROUP.
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE ANOTHER SUNSPOT
GROUP ROUNDING THE EAST LIMB JUST TO THE SOUTH OF 5034.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW.  THE POSSIBILITY OF ENERGETIC ACTIVITY FROM REGION 5027
HAS DECREASED.  MODERATE ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE FROM REGION
5032 IF IT CONTINUES TO DEVELOP.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 31/2100Z TO 01/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD AT MIDDLE LATITUDES HAS BEEN AT QUIET
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  THE HIGH LATITUDE FIELD HAS
BEEN UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY UNSETTLED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES AND
MOSTLY ACTIVE AT HIGH LATITUDES.
