JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 09 NOV 1988
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 08/2100Z
TO 09/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY WAS MODERATE. REGION 5218 (N11W36)
PRODUCED AN M9/1B FLARE WITH SIGNIFICANT RADIO BURSTS ON ALL THE
MONITORED FREQUENCIES, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT SWEEPS WERE OBSERVED.
IT GREW IN SOME PARAMETERS, AND STILL RETAINED ITS COMPLICATED
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE. TWO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED IN THE EAST-
NORTHEAST SECTOR. REGION 5212 (S16W81) RETAINED MOST OF ITS
COMPLICATED IDENTITY, BUT STILL DID NOT PRODUCE ANY SIGNIFICANT
ACTIVITY AGAIN THIS PERIOD.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
MODERATE. REGION 5218 PROVIDES A GOOD CHANCE OF MODERATE, AND A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF HIGH ACTIVITY. IT ALSO SUPPORTS A SLIGHT CHANCE
OF A PROTON PRODUCING FLARE. REGION 5212 ALSO CONTINUES TO
SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY OF MAJOR ACTIVITY.
