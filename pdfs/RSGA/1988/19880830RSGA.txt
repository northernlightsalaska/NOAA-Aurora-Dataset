LOW TO MODERATE.  REGION 5131 SHOULD GENERATE M-CLASS ACTIVITY
DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 29/2100Z TO 30/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN GENERALLY UNSETTLED AT MID-

EFFECTIVE 1 SEPTEMBER 1988, SESC WILL BE USING THE FOLLOWING
DEFINITIONS FOR SOLAR ACTIVITY LEVELS:

VERY LOW = X-RAY EVENTS LESS THAN C-CLASS
LOW      = C-CLASS X-RAY EVENTS
MODERATE = ISOLATED (1 TO 4) M-CLASS EVENTS
HIGH     = SEVERAL (5 OR MORE) M-CLASS EVENTS OR
   ISOLATED (1 TO 4) M5 OR GREATER X-RAY EVENTS
VERY HIGH = SEVERAL (5 OR MORE) M5 OR GREATER X-RAY EVENTS
