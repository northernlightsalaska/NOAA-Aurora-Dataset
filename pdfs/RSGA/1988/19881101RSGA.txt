TO 01/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN MODERATE.  NEW REGION
5218 (N11E69) PRODUCED AN M3/1N FLARE AT 01/1102Z.  THIS FLARE

5212 (S16E21) CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AND INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY.
THIS REGION WAS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO A LONG DURATION
(ABOUT THREE HOUR) C9.2 X-RAY ENHANCEMENT WHICH REACHED A
MAXIMUM AT 01/1649Z.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
