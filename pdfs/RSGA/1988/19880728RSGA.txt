IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 27/2100Z
TO 28/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LOW. THE LARGEST EVENT OF
THE PERIOD WAS AN UNCORRELATED C8 X-RAY BURST AT 28/0252Z. MINOR

FLARE AT 28/1212Z. REGIONS 5092 (N27E56) AND 5095 (N30E66) EACH
PRODUCED SEVERAL SUBFLARES DURING THE PERIOD AND MAY BE
INTERACTING. THESE REGIONS HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF STRONG
CALCIUM XV EMISSIONS. NO NEW REGIONS WERE ASSIGNED TODAY.
