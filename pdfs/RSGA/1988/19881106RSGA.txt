FROM SPACE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES CENTER, BOULDER, COLORADO
SDF NUMBER 311
JOINT USAF/NOAA REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
ISSUED 2200Z 06 NOV 1988
IA.  ANALYSIS OF SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS AND ACTIVITY FROM 05/2100Z
TO 06/2100Z:  SOLAR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN MODERATE. REGION 5212
(S17W45) PRODUCED AN M4/2B FLARE AT 06/1829Z. THE FLARE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY A 120 FLUX UNIT TENFLARE AS WELL AS MINOR
DISCRETE FREQUENCY BURSTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. REGION 5212
PRODUCED OCCASIONAL C-CLASS SUBFLARES PRIOR TO THE EVENT. REGION
5218 (N11E03) DISPLAYED A SMALL INCREASE IN MAGNETIC COMPLEXITY,
BUT REMAINED RELATIVELY QUIET DURING THE PERIOD. NEW REGION
5224 (N24W67) EMERGED TODAY AS A SMALL UNIPOLE. TWO CORONAL MASS
EJECTIONS WERE OBSERVED YESTERDAY. THE FIRST CME DEPARTED THE
NORTHEAST LIMB NEAR 05/0445Z. ITS VELOCITY WAS UNKNOWN. THE
SECOND DEPARTED THE SOUTHEAST LIMB BETWEEN 05/1100-1530Z AND WAS
OF AVERAGE VELOCITY; ITS SOURCE MAY HAVE BEEN FROM BEHIND THE
LIMB.
IB.  SOLAR ACTIVITY FORECAST:  SOLAR ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE
LOW TO MODERATE. REGION 5212 RETAINED ITS COMPLICATED MAGNETIC
STRUCTURE IN THE WAKE OF THE M4/2B. THEREFORE, ADDITIONAL
M-CLASS FLARES MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE REGION. THERE IS ALSO A
VERY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR X-CLASS ACTIVITY FROM THIS REGION.
REGION 5218 PROVIDES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR M-CLASS ACTIVITY.
IIA.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY FROM 05/2100Z TO 06/2100Z:
THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT QUIET TO UNSETTLED
LEVELS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. ISOLATED PERIODS OF ACTIVE TO
MINOR STORM LEVELS OCCURRED NEAR 06/0600Z AND 06/1500Z.
IIB.  GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY FORECAST:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD IS
EXPECTED TO BE QUIET TO UNSETTLED BECOMING UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE
DURING THE THIRD DAY IN RESPONSE TO TODAY'S FLARE ACTIVITY.
